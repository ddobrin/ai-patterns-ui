**Thimphu** ([/tɪmˈpuː/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); [Dzongkha](/wiki/Dzongkha_language "Dzongkha language"): ཐིམ་ཕུག [\[tʰim˥.pʰu˥\]](/wiki/Help:IPA "Help:IPA")) is the [capital](/wiki/Capital_city "Capital city") and largest city of [Bhutan](/wiki/Bhutan "Bhutan"). It is situated in the western central part of Bhutan, and the surrounding valley is one of Bhutan's *[dzongkhags](/wiki/Dzongkhag "Dzongkhag")* , the [Thimphu District](/wiki/Thimphu_District "Thimphu District"). The ancient capital city of [Punakha](/wiki/Punakha "Punakha") was replaced by Thimphu as capital in 1955, and in 1961 Thimphu was declared as the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan by the 3rd [Druk Gyalpo](/wiki/Druk_Gyalpo "Druk Gyalpo") [Jigme Dorji Wangchuck](/wiki/Jigme_Dorji_Wangchuck "Jigme Dorji Wangchuck").

The city extends in a north--south direction on the west bank of the valley formed by the Wang Chhu, which flows out into India as the [Raidāk River](/wiki/Raid%C4%81k_River "Raidāk River"). Thimphu is the [sixth highest capital in the world by altitude](/wiki/List_of_capital_cities_by_altitude "List of capital cities by altitude") and ranges in altitude from 2,248 metres (7,375 feet) to 2,648 metres (8,688 feet).^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[3\]](#cite_note-Buddhism-3)^^[\[4\]](#cite_note-Natural-4)^^[\[5\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._97-5)^^[\[6\]](#cite_note-Palin,_p._245-6)^ Unusually for a capital city, Thimphu does not have its own airport, instead relying on the [Paro Airport](/wiki/Paro_Airport "Paro Airport") (connected by road some 52 kilometres (32 miles) away).{#cite_ref-Palin,_p._245_6-0}

Thimphu, as the political and [economic center](/wiki/Economy_of_Bhutan "Economy of Bhutan") of Bhutan, has a dominant agriculture and livestock base, which contributes to 45% of the country's GNP.^[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)^ [Tourism](/wiki/Tourism_in_Bhutan "Tourism in Bhutan"), though a contributor to the economy, is strictly regulated, maintaining a balance between the traditional, development and modernization. Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan, including the [National Assembly](/wiki/National_Assembly_(Bhutan) "National Assembly (Bhutan)") of the newly-formed parliamentary democracy and [Dechencholing Palace](/wiki/Dechencholing_Palace "Dechencholing Palace"), the official residence of the King, located to the north of the city. Thimphu is coordinated by the "Thimphu Structure Plan, 2002-2027", an urban development plan with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley. Some of this development was undertaken with financial assistance from the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") and [Asian Development Bank](/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank "Asian Development Bank").{#cite_ref-7}

The [culture of Bhutan](/wiki/Culture_of_Bhutan "Culture of Bhutan") is fully reflected in Thimphu in literature, religion, customs, and national dress code, the monastic practices of the monasteries, music, and dance, and in the media. [Tshechu](/wiki/Tshechu "Tshechu") is an important festival when mask dances, popularly known as [Cham dances](/wiki/Cham_dance "Cham dance"), are performed in the courtyards of the [Tashichho Dzong](/wiki/Tashichho_Dzong "Tashichho Dzong") in Thimphu. It is a four-day festival held every year in September or October, on dates corresponding to the [Bhutanese calendar](/w/index.php?title=Bhutanese_calendar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bhutanese calendar (page does not exist)").

Before 1960, Thimphu consisted of a group of hamlets scattered across the valley including [Motithang](/wiki/Motithang "Motithang"), Changangkha, Changlimithang, Langchupakha, and Taba, some of which constitute districts of the city today (see below for district details).^[\[8\]](#cite_note-Pommaret,_163-8)^ In 1885, a battle was held at what is now the Changlimithang sports ground in Thimphu. The decisive victory opened the way for [Ugyen Wangchuck](/wiki/Ugyen_Wangchuck "Ugyen Wangchuck"), the first King of Bhutan, to virtually control the whole country.^[\[9\]](#cite_note-Pommaret,_173-9)^ Since this time the sports ground has been of major importance to the city; football, cricket matches and archery competitions take place there. The modern [Changlimithang Stadium](/wiki/Changlimithang_Stadium "Changlimithang Stadium") was built on the site in 1974. Under the Wangchuck dynasty, the country enjoyed peace and progress under successive reformist monarchs. The third king, [Jigme Dorji Wangchuck](/wiki/Jigme_Dorji_Wangchuck "Jigme Dorji Wangchuck"), reformed the old pseudo-feudal systems by abolishing serfdom, redistributing land, and reforming taxation. He also introduced many executive, legislative, and judiciary reforms. Reforms continued and in 1952 the decision was made to shift the capital from the ancient capital of [Punakha](/wiki/Punakha "Punakha") to Thimphu.^[\[8\]](#cite_note-Pommaret,_163-8)^ The fourth king, [Jigme Singye Wangchuck](/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck "Jigme Singye Wangchuck"), opened the country for development and India provided the needed impetus in this process with financial and other forms of assistance. In 1961, Thimphu officially became the capital of Bhutan.{#cite_ref-Pommaret,_163_8-1}

Bhutan joined the [Colombo Plan](/wiki/Colombo_Plan "Colombo Plan") in 1962, the [Universal Postal Union](/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union "Universal Postal Union") in 1969 and became a member of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") in 1971.

The fourth king, who had established the National Assembly in 1953, devolved all executive powers to a council of ministers elected by the people in 1998. He introduced a system of voting no confidence in the king, which empowered the parliament to remove the monarch. The National Constitution Committee in Thimphu started drafting the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan in 2001. In 2005, the fourth king of Bhutan announced his decision to hand over the reins of his kingdom to his son Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk. The coronation of the king was held in Thimphu at the refurbished [Changlimithang Stadium](/wiki/Changlimithang_Stadium "Changlimithang Stadium") and coincided with the centenary of the establishment of the [House of Wangchuck](/wiki/House_of_Wangchuck "House of Wangchuck").^[\[10\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._39-42-10)^^[\[11\]](#cite_note-kingdom-11)^^[\[12\]](#cite_note-Political-12)^ In 2008, this paved way for the transition from absolute monarchic rule to a parliamentary democratic constitutional monarchy, with Thimphu as the headquarters of the new government, with the national defined objective of achieving "[Gross National Happiness](/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness "Gross National Happiness")" (GNH) concomitant with the growth of [Gross National Product](/wiki/Measures_of_national_income_and_output "Measures of national income and output") (GNP).^[\[10\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._39-42-10)^^[\[11\]](#cite_note-kingdom-11)^^[\[12\]](#cite_note-Political-12)^{#cite_ref-Political_12-2}

Thimphu is situated in the constricted, linear valley of the Raidāk River, which is also known as the Thimphu River (*Thimpu Chuu* ). While the surrounding hills are in an altitudinal range of 2,000 to 3,800 metres (6,562--12,467 feet) (warm [temperate climate](/wiki/Temperate_climate "Temperate climate") between 2,000 to 3,000 metres (6,562--9,843 feet) and cold temperate zone between 3,000--3,800 metres (9,843--12,467 feet)), the city itself has an altitude range varying between 2,248 metres (7,375 feet) and 2,648 metres (8,688 feet). It is these two variations in altitude and climate which determine the habitable zones and vegetation typology for the valley. The valley, however, is thinly-forested and is spread out to the north and west. At the southern end of the city, the Lungten Zampa bridge connects the east and west banks of the Wang Chuu which flows through the heart of city.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^^[\[14\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._98-14)^{#cite_ref-Brown,_p._98_14-0}

The Raidāk River raises in the snow fields at an altitude of about 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). It has many tributaries that flow from the Himalayan peaks that largely dictate the topography of the Thimphu valley. The Thimphu valley, so formed, is delimited by a steep eastern ridge that rises from the riverbed and a valley formation with gradually sloping topography, extending from Dechencholing and Simtokha, on the western banks of the Raidāk. The north--south orientation of the hill ranges of the valley means that they are exposed to moist monsoon winds which engulf the inner Himalayas and its lower valleys. However, the [windward and leeward](/wiki/Windward_and_leeward "Windward and leeward") sides of the hill ranges have different vegetation patterns depending on the varying rainfall incidence in the two sides. Thimphu Valley, lying in the leeward side of the mountains, is comparatively dry and contains a different type of vegetation as compared to the windward side. Hence, the coniferous vegetation in the valley is attributed to this phenomenon. Punakha, the old capital of Bhutan, is on the windward side with broad-leaved trees dominating the topography.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[4\]](#cite_note-Natural-4)^^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^{#cite_ref-plan_13-1}

The city experiences a southwest [monsoon](/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon")-influenced [subtropical highland climate](/wiki/Oceanic_climate "Oceanic climate") ([*Cwb*](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification")). The southwest monsoon rainfall occurs during mid-April to September. Lightning and thunder often precedes rainfall in the region with [cumulonimbus clouds](/wiki/Cumulonimbus_clouds "Cumulonimbus clouds") and light showers dominating the weather.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[4\]](#cite_note-Natural-4)^ Continuous rainfall for several days occurs resulting in landslides and blockage of roads. Streams and rivers swell up carrying huge amounts of debris from forests. Deep puddles, thick mud, and landslides along roads form barriers to transportation. Cold winds, low temperatures at night, and moderate temperatures during the day, cloudiness, light showers and snowfall mark winter weather in this zone. Fog causes poor visibility, which poses a threat to vehicular traffic in the city.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[4\]](#cite_note-Natural-4)^ As spring approaches, the landscape is marked by violent winds and relatively dry and clear skies.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[4\]](#cite_note-Natural-4)^{#cite_ref-Natural_4-4}

### City planning {#City_planning}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thimphu&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: City planning")\]

Thimphu was selected to be the capital of Bhutan in 1952 but was not officially established as capital of Bhutan until 1961. It was then a hamlet of a few houses built, around the Tashichhoe Dzong. The city has expanded slowly over the years along river banks and on high ground. Lower plains along the river have also been occupied. It was only after the country was opened for foreign visitors that it grew rapidly. Thimphu is now a major city with all civic amenities such as well planned wide roads with traffic police controlling the traffic, banks, hotels and restaurants, institutions of arts, culture, media, sports and also the traditional [dzongs](/wiki/Dzongs "Dzongs"), [monasteries](/wiki/Monasteries "Monasteries") and [chortens](/wiki/Chortens "Chortens"). Consequently, a boom in property value in Thimphu has been reported.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[5\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._97-5)^^[\[26\]](#cite_note-Fraser-26)^^[\[27\]](#cite_note-Palin,_p._253-254-27)^{#cite_ref-Palin,_p._253-254_27-0}

The residential area of the city constitutes 38.3% of the total area. In the non-residential area, 9.3% of the city consists of administrative buildings, 4% of commercial establishments, 10.1% is taken up by health, educational or institutional structures, 2% by industrial establishments and 3.8% by security.^[\[26\]](#cite_note-Fraser-26)^ The remaining 32.5% of the city constitutes dispersed open spaces with vacant lands, which need to be preserved in any future planning and expansion.^[\[26\]](#cite_note-Fraser-26)^{#cite_ref-Fraser_26-2}

The Thimphu Structure Plan is a modern urban development plan for the Thimphu city, evolved in 1998, with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley, including its rivers and forests. This planning was necessitated due to growth of automobiles and pressure on the public health infrastructure in the town centre, restrictions imposed on plot coverage and building heights. The plan was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2003.^[\[28\]](#cite_note-Bhut-28)^ An elected body, the Thimphu Municipal Corporation, is implementing the plan, drawn up by the American architect [Christopher Charles Benninger](/wiki/Christopher_Charles_Benninger "Christopher Charles Benninger"). This plan is estimated to cost more than $1 billion when completed.^[\[28\]](#cite_note-Bhut-28)^ Funds for implementation of the plan are being provided by the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") and the [Asian Development Bank](/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank "Asian Development Bank"). There are some disputed areas between land owners and stakeholders, which has resulted in the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank requesting the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MOWHS) to resolve the issues through a process of the agreement, before further funds are released.^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^^[\[29\]](#cite_note-bhut-29)^^[\[30\]](#cite_note-fore-30)^{#cite_ref-fore_30-0}

The clear planning concepts that have been established within the 'Structured Plan' are: the Tashichheo Dzong, Wang Chuu and the streams, Green Hills and their Forest cover, monasteries, temples, chortens and prayer flags, the urban core, urban villages and the urban corridor. The southern entrance of the city at [Simtokha Dzong](/wiki/Simtokha_Dzong "Simtokha Dzong") anchors the city limits with the Northern and Western limits of the Wang Chuu Valley.^[\[30\]](#cite_note-fore-30)^^[\[31\]](#cite_note-dream-31)^{#cite_ref-dream_31-0}

Under a development plan for 2027, much of the city will be car-free pedestrian zones filled with arcaded walkways, plazas, courtyards, cafes, and exhibitions, with automobile traffic confined to the edges of the city. Parks and footpaths will be developed along riverfronts, and no construction will be allowed within 30 metres (98 feet) of a river or stream. City planners also announced that the rule that buildings be constructed to reflect traditional Bhutanese architecture, which was often violated in the past, would be enforced more strictly.

### Urban expansion {#Urban_expansion}

Over the last 50 years, since its establishment as the capital of Bhutan, Thimphu has witnessed expansion, initially at a slow pace, then rapidly after the country was opened up to the outside world after the coronation of the fourth King, [Jigme Singye Wangchuck](/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck "Jigme Singye Wangchuck"). Broadly, the city's natural systems are under three categories: natural (forest, bush cover, river, and watersheds), agricultural (orchards, rice paddies, grazing lands) and recreational (public open space, parks, stadium).^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^{#cite_ref-plan_13-3}

The urban expansion has seen a structured development plan for 2027.^[\[27\]](#cite_note-Palin,_p._253-254-27)^^[\[30\]](#cite_note-fore-30)^^[\[33\]](#cite_note-History-33)^ The buildings will continue to be built to retain ancient Bhutanese culture and architectural styles but with a measured and modulated blend of modern development, meeting requirements of national and civic administration and all basic civic amenities such as roads, water supply and drainage, hospitals, schools and colleges, electricity, media centres and so forth. The monuments or buildings of note are the sprawling [Tashichho Dzong](/wiki/Tashichho_Dzong "Tashichho Dzong"), built like a fortress, which is the centre of Bhutanese administration as well as monastic centre, the [Memorial Chorten, Thimphu](/wiki/Memorial_Chorten,_Thimphu "Memorial Chorten, Thimphu") and the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy within the monarchic rule. The Palace of the King located to the north of the city, called the [Dechencholing Palace](/wiki/Dechencholing_Palace "Dechencholing Palace"), the official residence of the King, is an impressive structure that provides a grand aerial view of the city.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[5\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._97-5)^^[\[27\]](#cite_note-Palin,_p._253-254-27)^{#cite_ref-Palin,_p._253-254_27-2}

Rapid expansion following the pattern of [rural exodus](/wiki/Rural_exodus "Rural exodus") has resulted in considerable rebuilding in the city centre and mushrooming of suburban development elsewhere. Norzin Lam, the recently upgraded main thoroughfare, is lined with shops, restaurants, retail arcades and public buildings.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[5\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._97-5)^^[\[27\]](#cite_note-Palin,_p._253-254-27)^{#cite_ref-Palin,_p._253-254_27-3}

Within the core area of the city, there is a mix of apartment blocks, small family homes and family-owned stores. By regulation, all buildings are required to be designed in traditional style with Buddhist paintings and motifs. A lively weekend market near the river supplies meat, vegetables and tourist items. Most of the city's limited light industry is located south of the main bridge. Thimphu has a growing number of commercial services and offices, which provide for ever-growing local needs.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[5\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._97-5)^^[\[27\]](#cite_note-Palin,_p._253-254-27)^{#cite_ref-Palin,_p._253-254_27-4}

The traditional architectural monuments in Thimphu, as in the rest of Bhutan, are of typical Bhutanese architecture of monasteries, dzongs (most striking fortress type structures), chortens, gateways, Lhakhangs, other sacred places and royal palaces, which are the most distinctive architectural forms of Bhutan. Prayer Flags, Mani Walls and Prayer Wheels present a propitious setting throughout the urban agglomerate of Thimphu. The most prominent architecturally elegant, traditional Bhutanese building structures in Thimphu are the [Tashichho Dzong](/wiki/Tashichho_Dzong "Tashichho Dzong"), [Drubthob Goemba](/w/index.php?title=Drubthob_Goemba&action=edit&redlink=1 "Drubthob Goemba (page does not exist)") (now the Zilluka nunnery), [Tango Goempa](/wiki/Tango_Monastery "Tango Monastery") or [Cheri Goempa](/wiki/Cheri_Monastery "Cheri Monastery"), the [Memorial Chorten, Thimphu](/wiki/Memorial_Chorten,_Thimphu "Memorial Chorten, Thimphu"), [Dechen Phodrang](/wiki/Dechen_Phodrang_Monastery "Dechen Phodrang Monastery"), and Changangkha Lhakhang, all vintage monuments with rich history.^[\[14\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._98-14)^^[\[30\]](#cite_note-fore-30)^^[\[34\]](#cite_note-Architecture-34)^{#cite_ref-Architecture_34-0}

These are further sanctified by the recent additions to the architectural excellence of buildings, a fusion of the traditional and modern architecture which are mostly post 1962, after Thimphu became the Capital of Bhutan and opened up for tourism under various Five Year Developmental Plans. The buildings under this category are the National Institute for Zorig Chusum, National Library, National Assembly cum SAARC Building, National Institute for Traditional Medicine, National Textile Museum, Voluntary Artists Studio, [Royal Academy of Performing Arts](/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Performing_Arts "Royal Academy of Performing Arts"), Telecom Tower and many more.

The [Tango Monastery](/wiki/Tango_Monastery "Tango Monastery") is located to the north of Thimphu near Cheri Mountain. It was founded by Lama [Gyalwa Lhanampa](/w/index.php?title=Gyalwa_Lhanampa&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gyalwa Lhanampa (page does not exist)") in the 13th century and built in its present form by [Tenzin Rabgye](/wiki/Tenzin_Rabgye "Tenzin Rabgye"), the 4th Temporal Ruler in 1688. According to local legend, the location of this monastery is the holy place where [Avalokiteshvara](/wiki/Avalokiteshvara "Avalokiteshvara") revealed himself as "the self-emanated form of the Wrathful Hayagriva". The location had been prophesied in Tibet.^[\[43\]](#cite_note-tango-43)^^[\[44\]](#cite_note-Pommaret-44)^ In 1616, the Tibetan Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal meditated in its cave.

Zhabdrung spent three years in strict retreat at Chagri and resided there for many periods throughout the rest of his life. It was at Chagri in 1623 that he established the first [Drukpa Kagyu](/wiki/Drukpa_Kagyu "Drukpa Kagyu") monastic order in Bhutan. The monastery, which is now a major teaching and retreat centre of the Southern Drukpa Kagyu order, is located at the northern end of Thimphu Valley, about 15 kilometres (9 mi) from the capital. It sits on a hill above the end of the road at Dodeyna and it takes about an hour's walk up the steep hill to reach the monastery from there. According to Bhutanese religious histories, the place was first visited by [Padmasambhava](/wiki/Padmasambhava "Padmasambhava") in the 8th century. In the 13th century, it was visited by [Phajo Drugom Zhigpo](/wiki/Phajo_Drugom_Zhigpo "Phajo Drugom Zhigpo"), the Tibetan Lama who first established the Drukpa Kagyu tradition in Bhutan.

The [Motithang Takin Preserve](/wiki/Motithang_Takin_Preserve "Motithang Takin Preserve") in Thimphu is a wildlife reserve area for [Bhutan takin](/wiki/Bhutan_takin "Bhutan takin"), the [National Animal](/wiki/National_Animal "National Animal") of Bhutan. Originally a mini-zoo, it was converted into a preserve when it was discovered that the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring the takin as a National Animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (*Budorcas taxicolor* ) is attributed to a legend of the animal's creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama [Drukpa Kunley](/wiki/Drukpa_Kunley "Drukpa Kunley"). The King of Bhutan believed that it was improper for a [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist") country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons, so he ordered the closure of the mini-zoo and the release of the animals into the forest. However, the Takin remained rooted to the town and were seen straying in the streets of Thimphu in search of fodder. Hence, an exclusive preserve was created for them to live freely.^[\[39\]](#cite_note-Lonely-39)^^[\[62\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p.87-62)^^[\[63\]](#cite_note-panda-63)^{#cite_ref-panda_63-0}

Initially, when Bhutan was opened up for tourism in 1974, the Government-owned Tourism Corporation was set up in Thimphu to encourage and organise individual and group tours to destinations of cultural importance in Bhutan, concentrating on Buddhism, [weaving](/wiki/Weaving "Weaving"), birds, nature and trekking, and any special package. This organization was privatised in 1994 and named as Bhutan Tourism Development Corporation. The corporation also owns and manages hotels and tourist lodges at all major tourist centres in Bhutan.

The Civic Administration of Thimphu city is the responsibility of the Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC). It was established in 1995 through a royal decree. It became an autonomous corporation in 1999, following the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1999. Its headquarters is at the Lungtenzampa zone of Thimphu. The corporation is headed by a mayor (Dasho Nima Wangdi) who is called *Thrompon* in the Bhutanese language. The mayor is appointed by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). An executive committee comprising 17 members governs the corporation; 8 members are elected from 6 zones and 7 members are nominated from government organizations and meet nearly every 6 weeks.^[\[70\]](#cite_note-back-70)^ However, its capacity to deal with the problems is hindered by lack of adequate staff (without any proportionate increase in staff strength to deal with its large jurisdiction) and its expenditure far outstrips the revenue earned.^[\[71\]](#cite_note-Municipal-71)^^[\[72\]](#cite_note-City-72)^ In order to provide cost effective services, the Corporation (as the regulating body) has contemplated privatization of public services, particularly water supply, solid waste, sewerage and parking.^[\[71\]](#cite_note-Municipal-71)^^[\[72\]](#cite_note-City-72)^{#cite_ref-City_72-1}

Thimphu metropolitan area has all the basic amenities. Further additions and improvements have been planned and are under implementation, as part of the 'Thimphu Structured Plan'. Water Supply, sanitation and health care have been fully addressed.  

#### Water supply and sanitation {#Water_supply_and_sanitation}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thimphu&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Water supply and sanitation")\]

Service-oriented municipal corporations have been established in the two biggest urban centres in Bhutan namely, Thimphu and [Phuentsholing](/wiki/Phuentsholing "Phuentsholing"). Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC) is the service organization that has the mandate for executing urban water supply and sanitation programmes in Thimphu city. TMC is an autonomous 'Civic Body' under the municipal charter granted in 2003, as per the Bhutan Municipal Act of 1999. However, the overall responsibility to formulate strategies and policies for human settlement in the country rests with the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement of the central government, as the nodal agency, with its subordinate Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services made responsible for executing urban water supply and sanitation programmes.^[\[73\]](#cite_note-water-73)^{#cite_ref-water_73-0}

Access to potable water is available to 90% of the population in Thimphu, though water supply is intermittent, attributed to leakage and high consumer demand.^[\[74\]](#cite_note-south-74)^{#cite_ref-south_74-0}

Conventional piped sewerage with lagoon treatment has been installed in the core areas of Thimphu with coverage of about 70%. However, the urban sanitation issues that have been flagged for action are: to ensure provision of flush toilets or latrines with proper septic tanks and soak pits in all new houses; dismantling VIP latrines and long drop toilets; to provide piped sewerage and wastewater treatment plants in all urban areas, allocation of funds for piped sewerage and treatment plant and awareness campaign on basic sanitation.^[\[73\]](#cite_note-water-73)^^[\[74\]](#cite_note-south-74)^{#cite_ref-south_74-1}

Thimphu also has an organised waste collection and disposal system. However, the quantum of waste generation in the city, which has about 6,982 households and 1,000 institutions, was projected to double in the period 2000--2010. At present, the solid waste disposal is at the sanitary landfill site, which may become inadequate soon. This problem is intended to be addressed by minimizing waste generation and adopting proper waste segregation methods.^[\[73\]](#cite_note-water-73)^^[\[74\]](#cite_note-south-74)^{#cite_ref-south_74-2}

Institute of Traditional Medicine

The Institute of Traditional Medicine was set up in 1979 with assistance from [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization "World Health Organization") (WHO) to develop and popularise Bhutanese herbal medicine, which has been used by the rural people in Bhutan for many centuries. The institute is located on a hill promontory above the Thimpu town. It is a semi-wooden structure built colourfully like a "Manor House". Traditionally, Bhutanese medicine has been influenced by traditional [Tibetan medicine](/wiki/Tibetan_medicine "Tibetan medicine") and also some aspects of [Indian medicine](/wiki/Ayurveda "Ayurveda"), particularly the "Three Humors of [bile](/wiki/Bile "Bile"), wind and [phlegm](/wiki/Phlegm "Phlegm")" that "dictates the state of our physical and spiritual health." The institute is well manned by scientists who claim that they have now developed a "mixture of five herbs that could "possess spermogenitic powers" (a kind of a [herbal](/wiki/Herbal "Herbal") [viagra](/wiki/Viagra "Viagra")), which is under testing before development and marketing on a commercial basis.

Music  
Further information: [Music of Bhutan](/wiki/Music_of_Bhutan "Music of Bhutan")

The [music of Bhutan](/wiki/Music_of_Bhutan "Music of Bhutan") has traditional genres such as [zhungdra](/wiki/Zhungdra "Zhungdra") and [boedra](/wiki/Boedra "Boedra"). The influence of [Drukpa Buddhism](/wiki/Drukpa_Kagyu "Drukpa Kagyu") and [Buddhist music](/wiki/Buddhist_music "Buddhist music") on Bhutanese culture is important. Many folk songs and chanting styles are derived from Drukpa music. In the 17th century, during the reign of [Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal](/wiki/Zhabdrung_Ngawang_Namgyal "Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal") (1594--1652) great blossoming of folk music and dance ([cham](/wiki/Cham_Dance "Cham Dance")) took place. Instruments dating to this time include the [lingm](/wiki/Lingm_(musical_instrument) "Lingm (musical instrument)") ([flute](/wiki/Flute "Flute")), [dramnyen](/wiki/Dramnyen "Dramnyen") ([lute](/wiki/Lute "Lute")) and [chiwang](/wiki/Chiwang "Chiwang")([fiddle](/wiki/Fiddle "Fiddle")). *Ynagchen* is an instrument made from hollow wood with 72 strings that are "struck with two bamboo sticks." [Rigsar](/wiki/Rigsar "Rigsar") music has become popular in Thimphu and Bhutan and is performed on electric piano and synthesiser. It is, however, a fusion of traditional Bhutanese and Tibetan tunes and is also influenced by [Hindi](/wiki/Hindi "Hindi") music. The music albums are produced by many popular [Bhutanese](/wiki/Bhutan "Bhutan") male and female singers not only in Rigsar music but also in traditional folk songs and religious songs. Four music CDs of religious folk music, called the 'Tibetan Buddhist Rites' released by the monasteries with a recording sung by a *manip* (a traveling ascetic) that reminisces the arrival of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in Bhutan in the 17th century is popular.^[\[90\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p._59-90)^^[\[95\]](#cite_note-95)^{#cite_ref-95}

It was only in the 1960s that roads were built in Bhutan and Thimphu when the Third King of Bhutan took the initiative after receiving education in it. Prior to that, education was limited to monastic teachings in monasteries, except for a few privileged people who went to [Darjeeling](/wiki/Darjeeling "Darjeeling") to receive western-type education. Dzongkha is compulsory in all schools. Schools are co-educational and education is not compulsory but school education is virtually free.^[\[105\]](#cite_note-Taylor,_p.795-105)^ Now, education has spread to all parts of the country. Thimphu has several educational institutions from schooling level to the college level in several disciplines. There are more private schools in Thimphu than in any other place in Bhutan, which are all under the control of the Department of Education. The National Training Authority administers three technical institutes.{#cite_ref-Taylor,_p.795_105-0}

### Roads {#Roads}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thimphu&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Roads")\]

The layout and position of the city roads in Thimphu are dictated by its unique topography. Most premier roads, typically wide, are aligned in a north--south direction, parallel to the river; the most important artery is the [Norzin Lam](/w/index.php?title=Norzin_Lam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Norzin Lam (page does not exist)") (*Lam* - road/street). Branch roads wind along the hill slopes leading to residential areas. Footpaths are also well laid with access to the commercial areas and the Wang Chu River. However, its entry point is at a narrow location from the south crossed by a wooden bridge. South of the bridge is the road to Paro, Punakha, [Wangdi Phodrong](/w/index.php?title=Wangdi_Phodrong&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wangdi Phodrong (page does not exist)"), [Tongsa](/wiki/Tongsa "Tongsa") and further to the east and north.^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^^[\[26\]](#cite_note-Fraser-26)^ The expressway which has been built has had a large impact on development, shifting land values, decreasing transportation costs, and increasing potential growth opportunity in the southern part of the valley.^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^{#cite_ref-plan_13-5}

Bhutan Transport Corporation runs a regular bus service from [Siliguri](/wiki/Siliguri "Siliguri") (which along with nearby [New Jalpaiguri](/wiki/New_Jalpaiguri "New Jalpaiguri") station are the nearest railheads) in India. It takes about four hours to reach Phuentsholing. From there, buses ply to Thimphu every day. Taxis can also be hired.^[\[108\]](#cite_note-cloud-108)^{#cite_ref-cloud_108-0}

The unique aspect of Thimphu roads and the traffic control over the road network is that it is one of the two [national capitals](/wiki/Capital_(political) "Capital (political)") in the world that does not have [traffic lights](/wiki/Traffic_lights "Traffic lights") (the other is [Ngerulmud](/wiki/Ngerulmud "Ngerulmud"), [Palau](/wiki/Palau "Palau")). Local authorities had installed a set of lights but before they became operational the lights were removed. Instead of traffic lights, the city takes pride in its traffic police that directs the oncoming traffic with their dance-like movement of their arms and hands.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Dzongkhag-2)^^[\[13\]](#cite_note-plan-13)^ City Bus services operate throughout the day.

Archery is central to the cultural identity of the nation and as a result all tournaments are started with a ceremony. Women come to witness the sports in their colourful best attire and cheer their favorite teams. Men stand close to the target and taunt the players, if targets are missed. The targets are spaced at 140-metre (460 ft) intervals. Teams which win the tournaments celebrate with their supporters by singing and performing a dance jig.^[\[117\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p.62-117)^ Archery is organized nationally within the [Bhutan Archery Federation](/wiki/Bhutan_Archery_Federation "Bhutan Archery Federation").^[\[118\]](#cite_note-118)^{#cite_ref-118}

The darts used in the game are made of a wood block set with a nail with fins of chicken feather.^[\[117\]](#cite_note-Brown,_p.62-117)^{#cite_ref-Brown,_p.62_117-2}

It had a capacity to hold 10,000 spectators. However, it was completely refurbished in 2007 to accommodate 25,000 spectators for the Centenary of Wangchuk dynasty rule in Bhutan and also the Coronation Celebrations of the fifth king of Bhutan, [Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck](/wiki/Jigme_Khesar_Namgyal_Wangchuck "Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck"), held on November 6, 2008. It now covers an area of about 11 hectares (27 acres). This was also the location where national celebrations were held from the time of the third King of Bhutan.
