**Georgetown** is the [capital](/wiki/Capital_(political) "Capital (political)") and largest city of [Guyana](/wiki/Guyana "Guyana"). It is situated in [Demerara-Mahaica](/wiki/Demerara-Mahaica "Demerara-Mahaica"), region 4, on the [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") coast, at the mouth of the [Demerara River](/wiki/Demerara_River "Demerara River"). It is nicknamed the "Garden City of the Caribbean." It is the retail, administrative, and financial services centre of the country, and the city accounts for a large portion of Guyana's GDP. The city recorded a population of 118,363 in the 2012 census.

All executive departments of Guyana's government are located in the city, including [Parliament Building](/wiki/Parliament_Building,_Guyana "Parliament Building, Guyana"), Guyana's Legislative Building and the Court of Appeals, Guyana's highest judicial court. The [State House](/wiki/State_House,_Guyana "State House, Guyana") (the official residence of the head of state), as well as the offices and residence of the head of government, are both located in the city. The [Secretariat](/wiki/Secretariat_of_the_Caribbean_Community "Secretariat of the Caribbean Community") of the [Caribbean Community](/wiki/Caribbean_Community "Caribbean Community") (CARICOM), an [international organization](/wiki/International_organization "International organization") with 15 memberstates and five partners, is also based in Georgetown.

Georgetown is also known for its British colonial architecture, including the tall painted-timber [St. George's Cathedral](/wiki/St._George%27s_Cathedral,_Georgetown "St. George's Cathedral, Georgetown") and the iconic [Stabroek Market](/wiki/Stabroek_Market "Stabroek Market").^[\[1\]](#cite_note-census-1)^{#cite_ref-census_1-1}

The city of Georgetown began as a small town in the 18th century. Originally, the capital of the [Demerara-Essequibo](/wiki/Demerara-Essequibo "Demerara-Essequibo") colony was located on [Borsselen](/wiki/Borsselen "Borsselen") Island in the [Demerara River](/wiki/Demerara_River "Demerara River") under the administration of the [Dutch](/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands"). When the colony was captured by the [British](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") in 1781, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Kingston chose the mouth of the Demerara River for the establishment of a town which was situated between Plantations [Werk-en-Rust](/wiki/Werk-en-rust "Werk-en-rust") and Vlissingen.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

It was the French who made it a capital city when they colonised it in 1782. The French called the capital Longchamps. When the town was restored to the Dutch in 1784, it was renamed [Stabroek](/wiki/Stabroek,_Guyana "Stabroek, Guyana") after [Nicolaas Geelvinck](/wiki/Nicolaas_Geelvinck "Nicolaas Geelvinck"), Lord of Stabroek, and president of the [Dutch West India Company](/wiki/Dutch_West_India_Company "Dutch West India Company"). Eventually the town expanded and covered the estates of Vlissingen, La Bourgade and Eve Leary to the North, and Werk-en-Rust and La Repentir to the South.

It was renamed Georgetown on 29 April 1812 in honour of [King George III](/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom "George III of the United Kingdom").^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^ On 5 May 1812, an ordinance was passed to the effect that the town formerly called Stabroek, with districts extending from La Penitence to the bridges in [Kingston](/wiki/Kingston,_Guyana "Kingston, Guyana") and entering upon the road to the military camps, shall be called Georgetown.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

The ordinance provided that the various districts of Georgetown shall be known by their own names. The supervision of Georgetown was to be done by a committee chosen by the governor and Court of Policy. Estimates of expenditure were to be prepared.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

By 1806, the owner of Vlissingen asked to be exempted from the responsibility of maintaining the road which is now called Camp Street, but the Court refused the request. In 1810, the maintenance of the roads in the area called Georgetown cost 11,000 guilders per annum.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

The governing body of Georgetown was once a Board of Police. The Board of Police was chosen by the governor and the Court of Policy. It came into existence as the result of disputes among various organisations which controlled the districts. The board met monthly but what was discussed is not on the records between 1825 and 1837. Newspapers in the colony were prohibited by law from reporting public matters.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

The post of Commissary of Police was not regarded as important. People elected to the board invariably declined to attend meetings and never gave reasons for their refusal. It was, therefore, decided that individuals elected to the board were bound to serve for two years, or suffer a penalty of 1,000 guilders. The Board of Police was abolished when an ordinance was passed to establish a mayor and town council.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

Georgetown gained official city status on 24 August 1842 during the reign of [Queen Victoria](/wiki/Queen_Victoria "Queen Victoria").^[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)^{#cite_ref-3}

The names of Georgetown's wards and streets reflect the influence of the Dutch, French, and British who administered the town at different periods of history.

Cummingsburg was originally named Plantation La Bourgade by its first owner, Jacques Salignac. It was laid out in streets and building lots by its second proprietor, Thomas Cuming, a Scotsman, from whom it gets its current name. He made a presentation of the [Militia Parade Ground](/wiki/Parade_Ground,_Georgetown "Parade Ground, Georgetown") and Promenade Gardens to the town as a gift. Carmichael Street was named after General [Hugh Lyle Carmichael](/wiki/Hugh_Lyle_Carmichael "Hugh Lyle Carmichael") who served as governor from 1812 to 1813. He died in March 1813 and was buried in the Officers' Cemetery, Eve Leary.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

Water Street was so called because it ran along the riverside and formed the original river dam. High Street formed the leading road from the East Bank to the East Coast of Demerara. The part of High Street that ran through Cummingsburg was called Main Street. Camp Street received its name because it was the road which led to the camp or garrison at the northern end of the city. Kingston got its name from King George of Great Britain. It was part of Pln. Eve Leary which was named after the wife or daughter of its owner, Cornelis Leary. Some of the streets of Kingston have military names because the garrison used to be located there, e.g. Parade Street, Barrack Street and Fort Street.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

Lacytown was another leasehold portion of Plantation Vlissengen. Luke M. Hill\*states that it was named after the lessee, George Lacy, who was related to the family of [General Sir George de Lacy Evans GCB](/wiki/George_de_Lacy_Evans "George de Lacy Evans"), a Crimean war hero.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^ The owner of Vlissengen was Joseph Bourda, Member of the Court of Policy. After his son and heir disappeared at sea, the government claimed the property under the authority of the Vlissengen Ordinance of 1876. A new district of Bourda was laid out and Lacytown was improved by the Board of Vlissengen Commissioners.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

Bourda Street and the ward of Bourda were named after Joseph Bourda, Member of the Court of Policy and former owner of Pln. Vlissengen. It was laid out by the Commissioner of Vlissengen in 1879. The [Bourda Cemetery](/wiki/Bourda_Cemetery,_Guyana "Bourda Cemetery, Guyana") holds the remains of many citizens of Georgetown. Only those persons who owned family vaults or burial rights in the enclosed ground used it.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

In 1945, a large fire (The Great Fire) broke out in the city, causing widespread damage.^[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)^{#cite_ref-4}

Georgetown is located on Guyana's Atlantic coast on the east bank of Demerara River estuary. The terrain in this part of the country where the city is located is flat coastal plains. The city is surrounded by a blanket of cane fields along with marshy swamps, and savannah lands on its east and south. The elevation of the land is one metre below the high tide level.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^ This low elevation is protected by a retaining wall known as the seawall to keep the ocean out and an innovative network of canals with kokers to drain the city of excess water.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^  

### Climate {#Climate}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Georgetown,_Guyana&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Climate")\]

Georgetown has a year-round hot trade-wind [tropical rainforest climate](/wiki/Tropical_rainforest_climate "Tropical rainforest climate") ([Af](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification")). Relative humidity fluctuates throughout the year with the highest occurring in May, June, August and December--January; these months are usually the rainiest part of the year. Between the months of September to November relative humidity is lower ushering in the drier season.

Georgetown does not truly have a [dry season](/wiki/Dry_season "Dry season") -- monthly precipitation in all 12 months is above 60 mm (2.4 in). Because of its location Georgetown's temperatures are moderated by the North-East [trade winds](/wiki/Trade_winds "Trade winds") blowing in from the North Atlantic and so it rarely sees temperatures above 31 degrees Celsius.
