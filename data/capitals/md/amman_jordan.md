In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed *Philadelphia* and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the [Decapolis](/wiki/Decapolis "Decapolis"). Later, in the 7th century AD, the [Rashidun Caliphate](/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate "Rashidun Caliphate") renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the [Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians.^[\[9\]](#cite_note-Hamed-9)^ The city grew after it was connected to the [Hejaz Railway](/wiki/Hejaz_Railway "Hejaz Railway") in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.^[\[10\]](#cite_note-Ref12-10)^{#cite_ref-Ref12_10-0}

Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as [Transjordan](/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan "Emirate of Transjordan")'s capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: [Palestinians](/wiki/Palestinians "Palestinians") in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011.

Etymology {#Etymology}
----------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amman&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Etymology")\]

Amman derives its name from the ancient people of the [Ammonites](/wiki/Ammon "Ammon"), whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it *Rabat ʿAmmān* (𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍),^[\[5\]](#cite_note-Lipiński-5)^ with the term *Rabat* meaning the "Capital" or the "King's Quarters". In the [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible"), the town is referred to as *Rabbaṯ Bənē ʿAmmōn* (רַבַּת בְּנֵי עַמּוֹן) or simply *Rabbā* (רַבָּה),^[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)^ and it appears in English translations as "Rabbath Ammon". [Ptolemy II Philadelphus](/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus "Ptolemy II Philadelphus"), the Macedonian ruler of the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom") who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city "Philadelphia" ([Ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Φιλαδέλφεια; literally: "[brotherly love](/wiki/Philia "Philia")"), after himself, after occupying it.^[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)^ By the Islamic era, the [Rashidun Caliphate](/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate "Rashidun Caliphate") restored its ancient semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.^[\[19\]](#cite_note-about-19)^{#cite_ref-about_19-0}

The [Neolithic](/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") site of [ʿAin Ghazal](/wiki/Ayn_Ghazal_(archaeological_site) "Ayn Ghazal (archaeological site)") today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary [Jericho](/wiki/Tell_es-Sultan "Tell es-Sultan")). At that time, the site was a typical [aceramic](/wiki/Aceramic "Aceramic") [Neolithic](/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster.^[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)^ The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around 600 meters (2,000 feet) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of ʿAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.^[\[22\]](#cite_note-gard-22)^{#cite_ref-gard_22-0}

ʿAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them.^[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)^ These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts depicted two-headed characters, the significance of which is not clear.^[\[22\]](#cite_note-gard-22)^{#cite_ref-gard_22-1}

In the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the [Ammonite Kingdom](/wiki/Ammon "Ammon"), and became known as "Rabat Amman". Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the [King's Highway](/wiki/King%27s_Highway_(ancient) "King's Highway (ancient)"), the ancient trade route connecting [Egypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") with [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), [Syria](/wiki/Syria_(region) "Syria (region)") and [Anatolia](/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia"). As with the [Edomites](/wiki/Edomites "Edomites") and [Moabites](/wiki/Moabites "Moabites"), trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue.^[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)^ [Milcom](/wiki/Milcom "Milcom") is named in the [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible") as the [national god](/wiki/National_god "National god") of Rabat Amman. Another ancient [deity](/wiki/Deity "Deity"), [Moloch](/wiki/Moloch "Moloch"), usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near [Amman Civil Airport](/wiki/Amman_Civil_Airport "Amman Civil Airport") uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a [pyre](/wiki/Pyre "Pyre") and used for [human sacrifice](/wiki/Human_sacrifice "Human sacrifice").^[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)^^[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)^{#cite_ref-26}

Amman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king [Hanun](/wiki/Hanun "Hanun") allied with [Hadadezer](/wiki/Hadadezer_ben_Rehob "Hadadezer ben Rehob"), king of [Aram-Zobah](/wiki/Zobah "Zobah"), against the [United Kingdom of Israel](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy) "Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)"). During the war, [Joab](/wiki/Joab "Joab"), the captain of King [David](/wiki/David "David")'s army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun's royal capital, and destroyed it ([2 Samuel 12:26--28](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/2_Samuel#12:26 "s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel"), [1 Chronicles 20:1--2](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/1_Chronicles#20:1 "s:Bible (King James)/1 Chronicles")). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king's crown, and brought it to his capital, [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") ([2 Samuel 12:29--31](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/2_Samuel#12:29 "s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel")). Hanun's brother, [Shobi](/wiki/Shobi "Shobi"), was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David ([2 Samuel 17:27](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/2_Samuel#17:27 "s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel")). Hundreds of years later, the prophet [Jeremiah](/wiki/Jeremiah "Jeremiah") foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city ([Jeremiah 49:2](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Jeremiah#49:2 "s:Bible (King James)/Jeremiah")).^[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)^^[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)^{#cite_ref-28}

Several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as [Rujm Al-Malfouf](/wiki/Rujm_Al-Malfouf "Rujm Al-Malfouf") and some parts of the [Amman Citadel](/wiki/Amman_Citadel "Amman Citadel"). The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure the protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east.^[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)^^[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)^ The city was later conquered by the [Assyrians](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire "Neo-Assyrian Empire"), followed by the [Babylonians](/wiki/Neo-Babylonian_Empire "Neo-Babylonian Empire") and the [Achaemenid Persians](/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire "Achaemenid Empire").^[\[31\]](#cite_note-KHh-31)^{#cite_ref-KHh_31-0}

Conquest of the [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") and [Central Asia](/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia") by [Alexander the Great](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great") firmly consolidated the influence of [Hellenistic culture](/wiki/Hellenism_(Greek_culture) "Hellenism (Greek culture)").^[\[31\]](#cite_note-KHh-31)^ The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including [Umm Qays](/wiki/Umm_Qays "Umm Qays"), [Jerash](/wiki/Jerash "Jerash") and Amman.

To the northeast of the theatre was a small [odeon](/wiki/Odeon_(building) "Odeon (building)"). Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts.

The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain.

In the 630s, the [Rashidun Caliphate](/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate "Rashidun Caliphate") conquered the region from the [Byzantines](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"), beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed "Amman" by the Muslims and became part of the district of [Jund Dimashq](/wiki/Jund_Dimashq "Jund Dimashq"). A large part of the population already spoke [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), which facilitated integration into the [caliphate](/wiki/Caliphate "Caliphate"), as well as several conversions to [Islam](/wiki/Islam "Islam"). Under the [Umayyad](/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate") caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous [desert castles](/wiki/Desert_castle "Desert castle") were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the [Amman Citadel](/wiki/Amman_Citadel "Amman Citadel") hill, known today as the [Umayyad Palace](/wiki/Umayyad_Palace "Umayyad Palace"). Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 747. The Umayyads were [overthrown](/wiki/Abbasid_Revolution "Abbasid Revolution") by the [Abbasids](/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate") three years later.^[\[35\]](#cite_note-DOA-35)^{#cite_ref-DOA_35-2}

The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the [Hejaz Railway](/wiki/Hejaz_Railway "Hejaz Railway"), which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual [Hajj](/wiki/Hajj "Hajj") pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the [Hejaz Railway](/wiki/Hejaz_Railway "Hejaz Railway") helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region.

### Climate {#Climate}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amman&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Climate")\]

Amman features a [hot-summer Mediterranean climate](/wiki/Hot-summer_Mediterranean_climate "Hot-summer Mediterranean climate") ([Köppen](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"): Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a [semi-arid climate](/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") (Köppen: BSh/BSk).

The [summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. [Spring](/wiki/Spring_(season) "Spring (season)") is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28 °C (82 °F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17 °C (63 °F), with sporadic [snowfall](/wiki/Snow "Snow") occurring once or twice a year.

The average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385 mm (15 in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250 mm (10 in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.

Amman experiences heavy [fog](/wiki/Fog "Fog") on about 120 days each year. The city's diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in [elevation](/wiki/Elevation "Elevation"). While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300 ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300 ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme [microclimates](/wiki/Microclimate "Microclimate") within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Amman&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Banking sector")\]

The [banking](/wiki/Bank "Bank") sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the [Arab Spring](/wiki/Arab_Spring "Arab Spring") uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the [Amman Stock Exchange](/wiki/Amman_Stock_Exchange "Amman Stock Exchange"). Amman is the base city for the international [Arab Bank](/wiki/Arab_Bank "Arab Bank"), one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by [market capitalization](/wiki/Market_capitalization "Market capitalization") on the exchange.^[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)^{#cite_ref-86}  

### Tourism {#Tourism}

Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.^[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)^ The expansion of [Queen Alia International Airport](/wiki/Queen_Alia_International_Airport "Queen Alia International Airport") is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.^[\[88\]](#cite_note-capacity-88)^{#cite_ref-capacity_88-0}

Amman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for [medical tourism](/wiki/Medical_tourism "Medical tourism"). Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1 billion annually.^[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)^{#cite_ref-89}

Amman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 [Iraq War](/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War"). Jordan's main airport, [Queen Alia International Airport](/wiki/Queen_Alia_International_Airport "Queen Alia International Airport"), is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier [Royal Jordanian](/wiki/Royal_Jordanian "Royal Jordanian"), a major airline in the region.^[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)^ The airline is headquartered in [Zahran district](/wiki/Zahran_district "Zahran district"). [Rubicon Group Holding](/wiki/Rubicon_Group_Holding "Rubicon Group Holding") and [Maktoob](/wiki/Maktoob "Maktoob"), two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as [Hikma Pharmaceuticals](/wiki/Hikma_Pharmaceuticals "Hikma Pharmaceuticals"), one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and [Aramex](/wiki/Aramex "Aramex"), the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.^[\[91\]](#cite_note-IraqBiz-91)^^[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)^{#cite_ref-92}

The population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population.^[\[8\]](#cite_note-RefC-8)^ It has a land area of 1,680 km^2^ (648.7 sq mi) which yields a population density of about 2,380 inhabitants per square kilometer (6,200/sq mi).^[\[97\]](#cite_note-97)^ The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city.^[\[98\]](#cite_note-DS34-98)^ Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of [Circassians](/wiki/Circassians "Circassians") settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity.^[\[99\]](#cite_note-99)^ After Amman became a major hub along the [Hejaz Railway](/wiki/Hejaz_Railway "Hejaz Railway") in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city.^[\[100\]](#cite_note-100)^ A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have [Palestinian](/wiki/Palestinians "Palestinians") roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.^[\[101\]](#cite_note-101)^{#cite_ref-101}

New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947.^[\[102\]](#cite_note-Suleiman101-102)^ About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from [Safed](/wiki/Safed "Safed"), [Haifa](/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") and [Acre](/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel"), migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the [1948 war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war").^[\[103\]](#cite_note-Plascov33-103)^ Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from [Nablus](/wiki/Nablus "Nablus").^[\[104\]](#cite_note-104)^ The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from [Jaffa](/wiki/Jaffa "Jaffa"), [Ramla](/wiki/Ramla "Ramla") and [Lydda](/wiki/Lod "Lod"), to Amman,^[\[103\]](#cite_note-Plascov33-103)^ whose population swelled to 110,000.^[\[102\]](#cite_note-Suleiman101-102)^ With Jordan's capture of the [West Bank](/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the [1967 War](/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War"). By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000.^[\[102\]](#cite_note-Suleiman101-102)^ A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 [Gulf War](/wiki/Gulf_War "Gulf War").

Amman has a mostly [Sunni Muslim](/wiki/Sunni_Muslim "Sunni Muslim") population, and the city contains numerous [mosques](/wiki/Mosque "Mosque").^[\[108\]](#cite_note-108)^ Among the main mosques is the large [King Abdullah I Mosque](/wiki/King_Abdullah_I_Mosque "King Abdullah I Mosque"), built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic [dome](/wiki/Dome "Dome") beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan.^[\[109\]](#cite_note-JTravel-109)^ The mosque is situated on [Jabal Ashrafieh](/wiki/Ashrafiyah,_Amman "Ashrafiyah, Amman"), the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: [Hanafi](/wiki/Hanafi "Hanafi"), [Hanbali](/wiki/Hanbali "Hanbali"), [Maliki](/wiki/Maliki "Maliki"), Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, [Ibadi](/wiki/Ibadi "Ibadi"), tassawuf-related [Sufism](/wiki/Sufism "Sufism"), [Muwahhidism](/wiki/Muwahhidism "Muwahhidism") and [Salafism](/wiki/Salafism "Salafism").^[\[110\]](#cite_note-110)^ Amman also has a small [Druze](/wiki/Druze "Druze") community.^[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)^{#cite_ref-111}

Nearby [Fuheis](/wiki/Fuheis "Fuheis") is a predominantly [Christian](/wiki/Arab_Christians "Arab Christians") town located to the northwest of the city.^[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)^ A small [Armenian Catholic](/wiki/Armenian_Catholic "Armenian Catholic") community of around 70 families is present in the city.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-113)^ [Ecclesiastical courts](/wiki/Ecclesiastical_court "Ecclesiastical court") for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in [Umm ar-Rasas](/wiki/Umm_ar-Rasas "Umm ar-Rasas") ruins in [Al-Jeezah](/wiki/Al-Jeezah "Al-Jeezah") district; the site is believed to have initially served as [Roman](/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims.

Amman has an extensive road network. Eight [roundabout](/wiki/Roundabout "Roundabout") "circles", which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks.^[\[36\]](#cite_note-KH-36)^ The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the [Abdoun Bridge](/wiki/Abdoun_Bridge "Abdoun Bridge"), which spans [Wadi Abdoun](/wiki/Wadi_Abdoun "Wadi Abdoun") and connects the [4th Circle](/wiki/List_of_roads_in_Amman#Circles "List of roads in Amman") to [Abdoun Circle](/wiki/Abdoun_Circle "Abdoun Circle").
