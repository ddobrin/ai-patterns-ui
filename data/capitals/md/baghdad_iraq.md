**Baghdad^[\[note 1\]](#cite_note-2)^** ([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"): بغداد‎, *Baghdād* ) is the capital and [largest city](/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_of_Iraq "List of largest cities of Iraq") of Iraq, located along the [Tigris](/wiki/Tigris "Tigris") in the central part of the country. With a population exceeding 7 million, it ranks among the [most populous cities](/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_in_the_Arab_world "List of largest cities in the Arab world") in the [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") and [Arab World](/wiki/Arab_World "Arab World") and forms 22% of the [country's population](/wiki/Demographics_of_Iraq "Demographics of Iraq"). Spanning an area of approximately 673 square kilometres (260 sq mi), Baghdad is the capital of the [Baghdad Governorate](/wiki/Baghdad_Governorate "Baghdad Governorate") and serves as Iraq's political, economic, and cultural hub.{#cite_ref-2}

Founded in 762 AD by [Al-Mansur](/wiki/Al-Mansur "Al-Mansur"), Baghdad was the capital of the [Abbasid Caliphate](/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate") and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into a cultural and intellectual center of the [Muslim world](/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world"). This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the [House of Wisdom](/wiki/House_of_Wisdom "House of Wisdom"), as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the "Center of Learning". For much of the Abbasid era, during the [Islamic Golden Age](/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age"), Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world (rivals [Chang'an](/wiki/Chang%27an "Chang'an")), as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely [destroyed](/wiki/Siege_of_Baghdad_(1258) "Siege of Baghdad (1258)") at the hands of the [Mongol Empire](/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire") in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires.

The [city was part](/wiki/Ottoman_Iraq "Ottoman Iraq") of the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire")'s [Baghdad Vilayet](/wiki/Baghdad_Vilayet "Baghdad Vilayet") until [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), when it was [captured by British forces](/wiki/Fall_of_Baghdad_(1917) "Fall of Baghdad (1917)"). Baghdad became the capital of the former [British Mandate of Mesopotamia](/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Mesopotamia "British Mandate of Mesopotamia") in 1921. With the recognition of Iraq as an [independent monarchy](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iraq "Kingdom of Iraq") in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of [Arab culture](/wiki/Arab_culture "Arab culture"). During the oil boom in Iraq, the city experienced a period of prosperity and growth. It faced [severe infrastructural damage](/wiki/Damage_to_Baghdad_during_the_Iraq_War "Damage to Baghdad during the Iraq War") due to the [Iraq War](/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War"), which began with the [2003 invasion of Iraq](/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq "2003 invasion of Iraq"), resulting in a [substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts](/wiki/Archaeological_looting_in_Iraq "Archaeological looting in Iraq"). Impacted by the subsequent [insurgency](/wiki/Iraqi_insurgency_(2011%E2%80%932013) "Iraqi insurgency (2011–2013)") and renewed [war](/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013%E2%80%932017) "War in Iraq (2013–2017)"), during this period, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, terrorist attacks have gradually been on the decline since the territorial defeat of the [Islamic State](/wiki/Islamic_State "Islamic State") militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare.

As capital of Iraq, Baghdad is location of the seat of government, national institutions and government ministries and serves as headquarters to numerous companies. It generates 40% of Iraq's GDP. A major center of [Islamic history](/wiki/Islamic_history "Islamic history"), it is home to [numerous historic mosques](/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_Baghdad "List of mosques in Baghdad"), as well as a large number of churches, *mandis* and [synagogues](/wiki/List_of_Jewish_sites_in_Iraq "List of Jewish sites in Iraq"), highlighting the city's historical diversity. Baghdad is home to [Mustansiriya University](/wiki/Mustansiriya_University "Mustansiriya University"), one of the oldest universities and [Masjid al-Kādhimayn](/wiki/Al-Kazimiyya_Mosque "Al-Kazimiyya Mosque") is visited every year by millions of Shi'ite pilgrims. The city is home to important cultural sites such as the [National Museum of Iraq](/wiki/Iraq_Museum "Iraq Museum"), the [Iraqi National Library](/wiki/Iraq_National_Library_and_Archive "Iraq National Library and Archive") and the [National Media Center](/wiki/National_Media_Centre_(Iraq) "National Media Centre (Iraq)"). It is also known as the "City of Palaces", as it is home to well known palaces.

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Baghdad&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Name")\]

The name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^ The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Baghdad was occupied by various peoples long before the Arab conquest of [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia") in 637 CE, and several ancient empires had capitals located in the surrounding area.^[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)^{#cite_ref-4}

Arab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in [Middle Persian](/wiki/Middle_Persian "Middle Persian").^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^ They suggested various meanings, the most common of which was "bestowed by God".^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^^[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)^ Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology,^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^ which views the word as a Persian compound of *bagh* ([![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Baghpahlavi.png/25px-Baghpahlavi.png)](/wiki/File:Baghpahlavi.png)) "god" and *dād* ([![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Dadpahlavi.png/30px-Dadpahlavi.png)](/wiki/File:Dadpahlavi.png)) "given".^[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)^^[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)^ In [Old Persian](/wiki/Old_Persian "Old Persian") the first element can be traced to *boghu* and is related to [Indo-Iranian](/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages "Indo-Aryan languages") *bhag* and [Slavic](/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages") *bog* "god."^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^^[\[7\]](#cite_note-Strange_pg_10-8)^ A similar term in Middle Persian is the name *Mithradāt* (*[Mehrdad](/wiki/Mehrdad "Mehrdad")* in [New Persian](/wiki/New_Persian "New Persian")), known in English by its borrowed Hellenistic form *Mithridates* , meaning "Given by [Mithra](/wiki/Mithra "Mithra")" (*dāt* is the more archaic form of *dād* , related to Sanskrit *dāt* , Latin *dat* and English *donor* ),^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^ ultimately borrowed from Persian *Mehrdad* . There are a number of other locations whose names are compounds of the Middle Persian word *bagh* , including [Baghlan](/wiki/Baghlan "Baghlan") and [Bagram](/wiki/Bagram "Bagram") in Afghanistan, [Baghshan](/wiki/Baghshan "Baghshan") in Iran itself,^[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)^ and [Baghdati](/wiki/Baghdati "Baghdati") in [Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_(country) "Georgia (country)"), which likely share the same etymological Iranic origins.^[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)^^[\[10\]](#cite_note-books.google.nl-11)^^[\[11\]](#cite_note-BRILL1987-12)^{#cite_ref-BRILL1987_12-0}

Other authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name *Bagdadu* or *Hudadu* that existed in [Old Babylonian](/wiki/Akkadian_language "Akkadian language") (spelled with a sign that can represent both *bag* and *hu* ), and the [Jewish Babylonian Aramaic](/wiki/Jewish_Babylonian_Aramaic "Jewish Babylonian Aramaic") name of a place called *Baghdatha* (בגדתא).^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^^[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)^^[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)^ Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-EI2-3)^{#cite_ref-EI2_3-7}

Another view, suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of "Baghdad" is derived from "[Akkad](/wiki/Akkad_(city) "Akkad (city)")", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad (𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠) is pronounced "*a-ga-dè* ^KI^" ("Agade") and its resemblance to "Baghdad" is compelling.^[\[14\]](#cite_note-15)^^[\[15\]](#cite_note-16)^{#cite_ref-16}

When the Abbasid caliph [al-Mansur](/wiki/Al-Mansur "Al-Mansur") founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name "City of peace" (Arabic: مدینة السلام, romanized: *Madīnat as-Salām*),which now refers to the [Round City of Baghdad](/wiki/Round_City_of_Baghdad "Round City of Baghdad") proper. Another explanation is that the Sorani Kurdish language words of *bagh* (باخ), which means "the garden of"; and *dad* (داد), which stands for "Justice". This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name.^[\[16\]](#cite_note-ما_معنى_اسم_مدينة_بغداد_ومن_سماه_؟-17)^^[\[17\]](#cite_note-ejabat.google.com-18)^^\[*[unreliable source?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources "Wikipedia:Reliable sources")*\]^ By the 11th century, *Baghdad* became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.{#cite_ref-ejabat.google.com_18-0}

Christophe Wall-Romana has suggested that al-Mansur's choice to found his "new city" at Baghdad because of its strategic location was the same criteria which influenced [Sargon](/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad "Sargon of Akkad")'s choice to found the original city of [Akkad](/wiki/Akkad_(city) "Akkad (city)") in the exact same location.^[\[18\]](#cite_note-19)^^[\[19\]](#cite_note-20)^{#cite_ref-20}

After the fall of the [Umayyads](/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate"), the first Muslim dynasty, the victorious [Abbasid](/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate") rulers wanted their own capital from which they could rule. They chose a site north of the [Sassanid](/wiki/Sassanid "Sassanid") capital of [Ctesiphon](/wiki/Ctesiphon "Ctesiphon"), and on 30 July 762^[\[20\]](#cite_note-21)^ the [caliph](/wiki/Caliph "Caliph") [Al-Mansur](/wiki/Al-Mansur "Al-Mansur") commissioned the construction of the city. It was built under the guidance of the [Iranian](/wiki/Iranian_peoples "Iranian peoples") [Barmakids](/wiki/Barmakids "Barmakids").^[\[21\]](#cite_note-22)^ Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic Empire under the Abbasids. The Muslim historian al-Tabari reported an ancient prediction by Christian monks that a lord named Miklas would one day build a spectacular city around the area of Baghdad. When al-Mansur heard the story, he became very joyful, for legend has it, he was called Miklas as a child.^[\[22\]](#cite_note-23)^ Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying: "This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward".^[\[23\]](#cite_note-24)^{#cite_ref-24}

The city's growth was helped by its excellent location, based on at least two factors: it had control over strategic and trading routes along the [Tigris](/wiki/Tigris "Tigris"), and it had an abundance of water in a dry climate. Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was quite uncommon during this time. The city of Baghdad quickly became so large that it had to be divided into three judicial districts: Madinat al-Mansur (the Round City), al-Sharqiyya ([al-Karkh](/wiki/Karkh "Karkh")) and Askar al-Mahdi (on the West Bank).^[\[24\]](#cite_note-25)^ Al-Mansur also planned out al-Karkh district so that he could separate the markets from the Round City in order to keep the turbulent populace away from the Round City to ensure that the gates would not be open at night for markets. Over time, the markets became diverse and a home to merchants and craftsmen. Officials with the title of "Muhtasib" were hired to look after markets to prevent cheating and check the weighs and measures of stocks.^[\[25\]](#cite_note-26)^{#cite_ref-26}

Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanians, which was located some 30 km (19 mi) to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [Salman Pak](/wiki/Salman_Pak "Salman Pak"), just to the south of Greater Baghdad which is where [Salman the Persian](/wiki/Salman_the_Persian "Salman the Persian") is believed to have been buried. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [Seleucia](/wiki/Seleucia "Seleucia"), the first capital of the [Seleucid Empire](/wiki/Seleucid_Empire "Seleucid Empire"), which had earlier replaced the city of Babylon.

According to the traveler [Ibn Battuta](/wiki/Ibn_Battuta "Ibn Battuta"), Baghdad was one of the largest cities,^\[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*\]^ not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly [Hanbalis](/wiki/Hanbali "Hanbali"). Baghdad is also home to the grave of [Abu Hanifa](/wiki/Abu_Hanifa "Abu Hanifa") where there is a cell and a mosque above it. The Sultan of Baghdad, [Abu Said Bahadur Khan](/wiki/Abu_Sa%27id_Bahadur_Khan "Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan"), was a Tatar king who embraced Islam.^[\[26\]](#cite_note-27)^{#cite_ref-27}

In its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the [Qur'an](/wiki/Qur%27an "Qur'an"), when it refers to [Paradise](/wiki/Paradise "Paradise").^[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWiet197113-28)^ It took four years to build (764--768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city.^[\[28\]](#cite_note-29)^ July was chosen as the starting time because two [astrologers](/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), [Naubakht Ahvazi](/wiki/Naubakht "Naubakht"), an [Iranian](/wiki/Iranian_peoples "Iranian peoples") [Zoroastrian](/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism"), and [Mashallah](/wiki/Mashallah_ibn_Athari "Mashallah ibn Athari"), an [Iranian Jew](/wiki/Persian_Jews "Persian Jews"), believed that the city should be built under the sign of the [lion](/wiki/Mesopotamian_lion "Mesopotamian lion"), [Leo](/wiki/Leo_(astrology) "Leo (astrology)").^[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWiet197112-30)^ Leo is associated with fire and symbolizes productivity, pride, and expansion and Leo's connection symbolically to Mithra.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^{#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWiet197112_30-0}

The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about 19 km (12 mi) in diameter. The inner city connecting them was designed as a circle about 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter, leading it to be known as the "Round City". The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first.^[\[30\]](#cite_note-ox-31)^ Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades.^[\[31\]](#cite_note-32)^ There was a large sanitation department, many fountains and public baths, and unlike contemporary [European](/wiki/Europe "Europe") cities at the time, streets were frequently washed free of debris and trash.^[\[32\]](#cite_note-33)^ In fact, by the time of Harun al-Rashid, Baghdad had a few thousand [hammams](/wiki/Turkish_bath "Turkish bath"). These baths increased public hygiene and served as a way for the religious to perform ablutions as prescribed by Islam. Moreover, entry fees were usually so low that almost everyone could afford them.^[\[33\]](#cite_note-Bobrick_2012_67-34)^ In the center of the city lay the [mosque](/wiki/Mosque "Mosque"), as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Near Eastern [urban design](/wiki/Urban_planning "Urban planning"). The Sasanian city of [Gur](/wiki/Firuzabad,_Fars "Firuzabad, Fars") in [Fars](/wiki/Fars_province "Fars province"), built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the center of the city. Much earlier, circular cities had existed in the Syro-Mesopotamian heartland, one of the better-known examples being [Mari](/wiki/Mari,_Syria "Mari, Syria"), while [Tell Chuera](/wiki/Tell_Chuera "Tell Chuera") and [Tell al-Rawda](/wiki/Al-Rawda_(tell) "Al-Rawda (tell)") also provide examples of this type of urban planning existing in Bronze Age [Syria](/wiki/Syria_(region) "Syria (region)"). This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and [Roman](/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.{#cite_ref-Bobrick_2012_67_34-0}

Baghdad was a hectic city during the day and had many attractions at night. There were cabarets and taverns, halls for backgammon and chess, live plays, concerts, and acrobats. On street corners, storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights.^[\[33\]](#cite_note-Bobrick_2012_67-34)^ Storytelling became a profession called "[al-Qaskhun](/wiki/Al-Qaskhun "Al-Qaskhun")" which survived until the modern era.^[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)^{#cite_ref-35}

The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [Kufa](/wiki/Kufa "Kufa"), [Basra](/wiki/Basra "Basra"), [Khurasan](/wiki/Greater_Khorasan "Greater Khorasan"), and [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria"); named because [their gates](/wiki/Gates_of_Baghdad "Gates of Baghdad") pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi). Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44 m thick at the base and about 12 m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30 m high, which included [merlons](/wiki/Merlon "Merlon"), a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [embrasures](/wiki/Embrasure "Embrasure"). This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50 m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by a solid [glacis](/wiki/Glacis "Glacis"), which is made out of bricks and [quicklime](/wiki/Quicklime "Quicklime"). Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

The Golden Gate Palace, the residence of the caliph and his family, was in the heart of Baghdad, in the central square. In the central part of the building, there was a green dome that was 48m high. Surrounding the palace was an [esplanade](/wiki/Esplanade "Esplanade"), a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria, a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph [Al-Amin](/wiki/Al-Amin "Al-Amin"), the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.^[\[35\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWiet197115-36)^ The roundness points to the fact that it was based on [Arabic script](/wiki/Arabic_script "Arabic script").^[\[36\]](#cite_note-37)^^[\[37\]](#cite_note-38)^ The two designers who were hired by [Al-Mansur](/wiki/Al-Mansur "Al-Mansur") to plan the city's design were [Naubakht](/wiki/Naubakht "Naubakht"), a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and [Mashallah](/wiki/Mashallah_ibn_Athari "Mashallah ibn Athari"), a Jew from [Khorasan](/wiki/Khorasan_province "Khorasan province"), [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran").^[\[38\]](#cite_note-ref2-39)^{#cite_ref-ref2_39-0}

Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.^[\[54\]](#cite_note-mackensen-55)^ Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous [Al-Ma'mun](/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun "Al-Ma'mun"), who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by [Sabur ibn Ardashir](/wiki/Sabur_ibn_Ardashir "Sabur ibn Ardashir") in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy.^[\[54\]](#cite_note-mackensen-55)^ This second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society.^[\[54\]](#cite_note-mackensen-55)^ The last two were examples of *madrasa* or theological college libraries. The [Nezamiyeh](/wiki/Nezamiyeh "Nezamiyeh") was founded by the Persian [Nizam al-Mulk](/wiki/Nizam_al-Mulk "Nizam al-Mulk"), who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans.^[\[54\]](#cite_note-mackensen-55)^ It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The [Mustansiriyah *madrasa*](/wiki/Mustansiriya_Madrasah "Mustansiriya Madrasah"), which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by [Al-Mustansir](/wiki/Al-Mustansir_(Baghdad) "Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)"), the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242.^[\[54\]](#cite_note-mackensen-55)^ This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.{#cite_ref-mackensen_55-4}

The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the [Tigris](/wiki/Tigris "Tigris") river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called "[Risafa](/wiki/Al-Rusafa,_Iraq "Al-Rusafa, Iraq")" and the Western half known as "[Karkh](/wiki/Karkh "Karkh")". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of [quaternary](/wiki/Quaternary "Quaternary") [alluvial](/wiki/Alluvium "Alluvium") origin due to periodic large flooding of the Tigris river. The [Diyala river](/wiki/Diyala_river "Diyala river") is a tributary of the Tigris, flowing southeast of the city and bordering its eastern suburbs.

Baghdad is 529.8 kilometres (329.2 mi) northwest of [Basra](/wiki/Basra "Basra"), 402.9 kilometres (250.4 mi) south of [Mosul](/wiki/Mosul "Mosul"), 366.8 kilometres (227.9 mi) south of [Erbil](/wiki/Erbil "Erbil") and 103.8 kilometres (64.5 mi) northeast of [Karbala](/wiki/Karbala "Karbala").^[\[102\]](#cite_note-103)^ Located to the south is [Mahmoudiyah](/wiki/Mahmoudiyah,_Iraq "Mahmoudiyah, Iraq"), which serves as the gateway to Baghdad.{#cite_ref-103}

Administratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into [districts](/wiki/Kaza "Kaza") which are further divided into [sub-districts](/wiki/Nahiyah "Nahiyah").^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a [mayor](/wiki/Mayor "Mayor") who oversees the municipalities.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [Coalition Provisional Authority](/wiki/Coalition_Provisional_Authority "Coalition Provisional Authority") (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in the official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^{#cite_ref-:4_114-7}

Each neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood's population.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^ There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (*Nahia* ) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (*Qada* ).^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^{#cite_ref-:4_114-14}

As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:^[\[113\]](#cite_note-:4-114)^{#cite_ref-:4_114-15}

The [Baghdad Metro](/wiki/Baghdad_Metro "Baghdad Metro") project was first proposed during the 1970s but did not come to fruition due to wars and sanctions. After the Iraq war, Iraqi authorities intended to revive the project, but it was again delayed due to domestic instability.^[\[177\]](#cite_note-178)^ In 2019, it was reported that Korean [Hyundai](/wiki/Hyundai_Rotem "Hyundai Rotem") and French [Alstom](/wiki/Alstom "Alstom") would be building the metro.^[\[178\]](#cite_note-179)^ However, the planned construction did not happen.{#cite_ref-179}

As of February 2024, the current plan consisted of fully electric and automated (driverless) trains running on an extensive railway network including an underground railway portion as well as an elevated railway. The proposed Baghdad Metro system includes seven main lines with a total length of more than 148 kilometres, 64 metro stations, four workshops and depots for trains, several operations control centers (OCC) and seven main power stations (MPS) with a capacity of 250 mega-watts, and several Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) towers. The metro will be equipped with CCTV and internet as well as USB ports for charging. Special compartments will be allocated for women and children as well as seats for people with special needs, pregnant women, and the elderly. The metro stations will be connected to other public transport networks such as buses and taxis, and 10 parking spaces will be available for commuters. The planned operating speed will be 80--140 km/hour with an estimated 3.25 million riders per day.^[\[179\]](#cite_note-180)^{#cite_ref-180}

In July 2024, it was announced that an international consortium of German French, Spanish, and Turkish companies was awarded $17.5 billion contract to construct Baghdad's metro.^[\[180\]](#cite_note-181)^ The consortium includes Alstom, [Systra](/wiki/Systra "Systra"), [SNCF](/wiki/SNCF "SNCF"), [Talgo](/wiki/Talgo "Talgo"), [Deutsche Bank](/wiki/Deutsche_Bank "Deutsche Bank") and [SENER](/wiki/SENER "SENER"). The consortium was then to negotiate the technical, financial and operational details of the project which is now estimated to be completed in May 2029.^[\[181\]](#cite_note-182)^{#cite_ref-182}

Baghdad has always played a significant role in the broader [Arab cultural sphere](/wiki/Arab_culture "Arab culture"), contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab") poets and singers such as [Nizar Qabbani](/wiki/Nizar_Qabbani "Nizar Qabbani"), [Umm Kulthum](/wiki/Umm_Kulthum "Umm Kulthum"), [Fairuz](/wiki/Fairuz "Fairuz"), [Salah Al-Hamdani](/wiki/Salah_Al-Hamdani "Salah Al-Hamdani"), [Ilham al-Madfai](/wiki/Ilham_al-Madfai "Ilham al-Madfai") and others have performed for the city. The dialect of [Arabic spoken in Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad_Arabic "Baghdad Arabic") today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, *The Arabic Language* ). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late [Middle Ages](/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). For poetry written about Baghdad, see [Reuven Snir](/wiki/Reuven_Snir "Reuven Snir") (ed.), *Baghdad: The City in Verse* (Harvard, 2013).^[\[207\]](#cite_note-208)^ Baghdad joined the [UNESCO Creative Cities Network](/wiki/Creative_Cities_Network "Creative Cities Network") as a City of Literature in December 2015.^[\[208\]](#cite_note-209)^{#cite_ref-209}

Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include the [National Theater](/wiki/National_Theater_(Iraq) "National Theater (Iraq)"), which was looted during the [2003 invasion of Iraq](/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq "2003 invasion of Iraq"), but efforts are underway to restore the theater.^[\[209\]](#cite_note-210)^ The live theater industry received a boost during the 1990s, when UN [sanctions](/wiki/Economic_sanctions "Economic sanctions") limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theaters were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of [comedies](/wiki/Comedy "Comedy") and dramatic productions.^[\[210\]](#cite_note-211)^ Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include [The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad](/wiki/The_Music_and_Ballet_School_of_Baghdad "The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad") and the Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad. The [Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra](/wiki/Iraqi_National_Symphony_Orchestra "Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra") is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Mandaeans had cultural club in Al-Zawraa, where poetry evenings and cultural seminars were held, attended by poets, writers, artists, officials, and dignitaries of the communities.^[\[211\]](#cite_note-:45-212)^ There is also a social cultural center of Mandaeans at al-Qadisiyyah.^[\[211\]](#cite_note-:45-212)^ [Baghdad Jewish Community Center](/wiki/Baghdad_Jewish_Community_Center "Baghdad Jewish Community Center") is located in [Al-Rashid Street](/wiki/Al-Rashid_Street "Al-Rashid Street").^[\[212\]](#cite_note-213)^{#cite_ref-213}

Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed [artifacts](/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology) "Artifact (archaeology)") and relics of [ancient civilization](/wiki/Ancient_civilization "Ancient civilization"); many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.

During [occupation of Iraq](/wiki/Occupation_of_Iraq_(2003%E2%80%932011) "Occupation of Iraq (2003–2011)"), [AFN Iraq](/wiki/AFN_Iraq "AFN Iraq") ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called "Dijlah" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the [Jamia](/wiki/Jamia "Jamia") neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.^[\[213\]](#cite_note-214)^{#cite_ref-214}

Baghdad is home to some of the most successful [football (soccer)](/wiki/Association_football "Association football") teams in Iraq, the biggest being [Al-Shorta](/wiki/Al-Shorta_SC "Al-Shorta SC") (Police), [Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya](/wiki/Al-Quwa_Al-Jawiya "Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya") (Air Force), [Al-Zawraa](/wiki/Al-Zawraa_SC "Al-Zawraa SC"), and [Al-Talaba](/wiki/Al-Talaba_SC "Al-Talaba SC") (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is [Al-Shaab Stadium](/wiki/Al-Shaab_Stadium "Al-Shaab Stadium"), which was opened in 1966. In recent years, the capital has seen the building of several football stadiums which are meant be opened in near future. The city has also had a strong tradition of [horse racing](/wiki/Horse_racing "Horse racing") ever since [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.^[\[214\]](#cite_note-215)^{#cite_ref-215}
