**Aden** ([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): عَدَنْ, [romanized](/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): *ʿAdan*, [Old South Arabian](/wiki/Old_South_Arabian "Old South Arabian"): 𐩲𐩵𐩬) is a port city located in [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen") in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, positioned near the eastern approach to the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea"). It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the [Bab-el-Mandeb](/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb "Bab-el-Mandeb") strait and north of the [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden"). With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting [Africa](/wiki/Africa "Africa"), [Asia](/wiki/Asia "Asia"), and the [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"). As of 2023, Aden City has a population of approximately 1,080,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.^[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)^ Aden is divided into eight districts: [Tawahi](/wiki/Tawahi_(Aden) "Tawahi (Aden)"), [Mualla](/wiki/Mualla "Mualla"), [Crater](/wiki/Crater_(Aden) "Crater (Aden)"), [Khur Maksar](/wiki/Khur_Maksar_District "Khur Maksar District"), [Al Mansura](/wiki/Al-Mansoura_(Aden) "Al-Mansoura (Aden)"), [Dar Sad](/wiki/Dar_Sad_District "Dar Sad District"), [Sheikh Othman](/wiki/Sheikh_Othman "Sheikh Othman"), and [Al Buraiqa](/wiki/Al_Buraiqeh_District "Al Buraiqeh District"). These form today's Aden Governorate. During the period of the British colonialism, Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khur Maksar District. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqa District.{#cite_ref-8}
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/ADEN_%26_LITTLE_ADEN-01.png/215px-ADEN_%26_LITTLE_ADEN-01.png)](/wiki/File:ADEN_%26_LITTLE_ADEN-01.png) Map showing Aden and Little Aden within the modern-day Governorate of Aden

Before gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly "Steamer Point"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the [isthmus](/wiki/Isthmus "Isthmus") connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, [Aden University's](/wiki/University_of_Aden "University of Aden") main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the [South Arabian Federation](/wiki/Federation_of_South_Arabia "Federation of South Arabia"), now housing a large power/[desalination](/wiki/Desalination "Desalination") facility and additional Aden University faculties.

Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the [oil refinery](/wiki/Oil_refinery "Oil refinery") and tanker port. Both were established and operated by [British Petroleum](/wiki/BP "BP") until they were turned over to [South Yemeni](/wiki/South_Yemen "South Yemen") government ownership and control in 1978.

Aden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its [unity](/wiki/Yemeni_unification "Yemeni unification") with [North Yemen](/wiki/Yemen_Arab_Republic "Yemen Arab Republic") in 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the [2014 *Coup d'état*](/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Yemeni civil war (2014–present)"), hosting some members of the [Cabinet of Yemen](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Yemen "Cabinet of Yemen") mainly in [al-Maashiq Palace](/wiki/Al-Maashiq_Palace "Al-Maashiq Palace"). It is also the seat of the secessionist [Southern Transitional Council](/wiki/Southern_Transitional_Council "Southern Transitional Council"), which exercises control over the city.^[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)^{#cite_ref-9}  

Etymology {#Etymology}
----------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aden&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Etymology")\]

Aden is a home and a place for ships, and the word Aden means reside in the place, so the word "Aden" means resident, and it is said "Aden Al-Balad", meaning the settlement of the country.^[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)^ Among the sayings of geographers about the city:{#cite_ref-10}

[Yaqut al-Hamwi](/wiki/Yaqut_al-Hamawi "Yaqut al-Hamawi") said:^[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)^ "It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade." And it is added to [Abyan](/wiki/Abyan_Governorate "Abyan Governorate"), which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.{#cite_ref-11}

[Ibn Manzur](/wiki/Ibn_Manzur "Ibn Manzur") said:^[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)^ "It is a country on the edge of the sea in the furthest part of Yemen."{#cite_ref-12}

[Ibn Khaldun](/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun "Ibn Khaldun") said:^[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)^ "This Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often."{#cite_ref-13}

### Antiquity {#Antiquity}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aden&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Antiquity")\]

Aden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name ([Ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Αραβία Εμπόριον, [romanized](/wiki/Romanization_of_Ancient_Greek "Romanization of Ancient Greek"): *Arabia Emporion*), which means an Arabic trade port.^[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)^ The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as [Eudaemon](/wiki/Eudaemon "Eudaemon") ([Ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Ευδαίμων, meaning "blissful, prosperous",) in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the *[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea](/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea "Periplus of the Erythraean Sea")* . The same work describes Aden as "a village by the shore", which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little-developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage, Aden was more an island than a peninsula as the [isthmus](/wiki/Isthmus "Isthmus") (a [tombolo](/wiki/Tombolo "Tombolo")) was not then so developed as it is today. Aden was explicitly mentioned by this name in the [Book of Ezekiel](/wiki/Book_of_Ezekiel "Book of Ezekiel"), which talks about Jerusalem, and it says:^[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)^{#cite_ref-15}
> "The merchants of [Sheba](/wiki/Sheba "Sheba") and Raamah are your merchants. They set up your markets with the finest perfumes and every precious stone and gold. Harran, Qena, and Aden are the merchants of Sheba, and Assyria and Kilmud are your merchants."

At its beginning, the city was a small peninsula with no significant natural resources, but its location between Egypt and India made it important in the ancient Indian Ocean trade route. The city was the home of the ancient Kingdom of Osan from the eighth to seventh centuries BC.^[\[16\]](#cite_note-Gentiles'_p.89-16)^ In the beginning of the seventh century BC, [Karbil Watar I](/wiki/Karib%27il_Watar "Karib'il Watar"), king of the Kingdom of Sheba, launched a campaign against Osan during which, according to the Sabaean texts, sixteen thousand people were killed, forty thousand people were enslaved, and the kings of [Awsan](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Awsan "Kingdom of Awsan") made offerings to the god.^[\[17\]](#cite_note-Daniel_McLaughlin_p.175-17)^ [al-Maqah](/wiki/Almaqah "Almaqah"), according to the inscription that Karbiel Watar I left in [Sirwah](/wiki/Sirwah "Sirwah"), commemorating his victory.^[\[18\]](#cite_note-Conti_Rossini_1931_p.55-18)^{#cite_ref-Conti_Rossini_1931_p.55_18-0}

In the second half of the first century BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar determined to control Arabia Felix and reach the Indian Ocean. The Roman governor of Egypt, Aelius Gallus, was sent in 25 BC. The campaign ended with disastrous results and the annihilation of the Roman army in front of the walls of Ma'rib.^[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)^ The Himyarites overthrew the Kingdom of Sheba in 275 AD and took control of Aden.^[\[20\]](#cite_note-Volume_1_p.252-20)^ Recent incomplete archaeological studies suggest that the Himyarites were the ones who built the huge water cisterns currently known as the "Cisterns of Aden", which stored approximately 136,382,757 liters of water.^[\[21\]](#cite_note-T._Norris,_F._W_1955-21)^^[\[22\]](#cite_note-Sir_Robert_Lambert_Playfair_p.7-22)^{#cite_ref-Sir_Robert_Lambert_Playfair_p.7_22-0}

The Himyarite Kingdom fell in the first quarter of the sixth century AD. Yusuf Dhu Nuwas mentioned Bab al-Mandab in one of his writings. The forces of the Kingdom of Aksum were entering Yemen through it. The [Byzantine](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") Emperor [Justinian I](/wiki/Justinian_I "Justinian I") sent a fleet to fight the Himyarite Jews and support the Kingdom of Aksum and the Christians of Najran. The fleet entered through Aden. Byzantine sources indicate that the [Sasanian Empire](/wiki/Sasanian_Empire "Sasanian Empire") took control of the city in 571 AD.^[\[23\]](#cite_note-Richard_Frye_p.325-23)^^[\[24\]](#cite_note-ReferenceB-24)^{#cite_ref-ReferenceB_24-0}

A local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that [Cain and Abel](/wiki/Cain_and_Abel "Cain and Abel") are buried somewhere in the city.^[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)^{#cite_ref-25}  

### Medieval history {#Medieval_history}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aden&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Medieval history")\]

Although the pre-Islamic [Himyar](/wiki/Himyar "Himyar") civilization was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the [Hadhramaut](/wiki/Hadhramaut "Hadhramaut") make it clear that both the Himyar and the [Sabean](/wiki/Sabaeans "Sabaeans") cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watchtowers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians [Ibn al Mujawir](/wiki/Ibn_al-Mujawir "Ibn al-Mujawir") and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.

With the introduction of Islam to Yemen in the seventh century AD, Aden experienced a period of stagnation that lasted until the ninth century AD.^[\[26\]](#cite_note-Daniel_McLaughlin_p.1752-26)^ In the early years of Islam, Aden belonged to the province of Jund (Taiz).^[\[27\]](#cite_note-Early_Islam_p.182-27)^ It was controlled by the state of [Ziyadid](/wiki/Ziyadid_dynasty "Ziyadid dynasty") and the [Sulayhid](/wiki/Sulayhid_dynasty "Sulayhid dynasty"). After the death of [Ali bin Muhammad Al-Sulayhi](/wiki/Ali_al-Sulayhi "Ali al-Sulayhi"), his son took charge of [Zurayids](/wiki/Zurayids "Zurayids"), and Aden continued to pay the annual royalty until [Queen Arwa bint Ahmed Al-Sulayhi](/wiki/Arwa_al-Sulayhi "Arwa al-Sulayhi") reduced it.^[\[28\]](#cite_note-H.C._Kay,_Yaman_1892,_pp._66-7-28)^ After the fall of the Sulayhid state, the Banu Zurayi became independent in Aden, taking advantage of the Sulayhids' preoccupation with the [Khawlan](/wiki/Khawlan "Khawlan") tribes.^[\[29\]](#cite_note-عمارة_بن_علي_تاريخ_اليمن_ص_174-29)^ The Zurayites continued to rule Aden, Lahj, and Abyan for less than forty years until they fell under the Ayyubids' control of the city.^[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)^ A major battle took place between [Turan Shah bin Ayyub](/wiki/Turan-Shah "Turan-Shah") and Yasser bin Bilal al-Muhammadi, Minister of State, and the Zurayiyyah were defeated and al-Muhammadi fled to Taiz.^[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)^ One of the most important contributors to the defeat of the Zurayids was their ongoing wars with the Bani Mahdi in [Tihama](/wiki/Tihamah "Tihamah") and the departure of their army to confront the Ayyubids instead of fortifying themselves in Aden.^[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)^{#cite_ref-32}

After 1175, rebuilding in a more solid form began, and ever since then Aden has been a popular city attracting sailors and merchants from [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), [Sindh](/wiki/Sindh "Sindh"), [Gujarat](/wiki/Gujarat "Gujarat"), [East Africa](/wiki/East_Africa "East Africa") and even [China](/wiki/China "China"). According to [Muqaddasi](/wiki/Muqaddasi "Muqaddasi"), Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century.^[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)^^[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)^ It was visited by the medieval scholar [Ibn Battuta](/wiki/Ibn_Battuta "Ibn Battuta") in the 14th century, who described Aden's reservoirs, the [Cisterns of Tawila](/wiki/Cisterns_of_Tawila "Cisterns of Tawila"), "These reservoirs accumulate rainwater for the sole purpose of drinking for the city's citizens."{#cite_ref-34}

During the Ayyubid period in Yemen, Sana'a and its environs were more hostile to their presence than other regions.^[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)^ The Zaidi tribes were able to defeat the Ayyubids in 1226, but Omar bin Rasul, the founder of the [Rasulid state](/wiki/Rasulid_dynasty "Rasulid dynasty"), was able to repel them, so he tightened his control over Aden. The city regained its position during the days of the Rasulids, so they dug wells and built schools, and Aden flourished commercially.^[\[36\]](#cite_note-Aden_p.23-36)^ The kings of Bani Rasul were also merchants and enacted a number of laws and regulations to codify trade in the city.^[\[37\]](#cite_note-Aden_p.24-37)^{#cite_ref-Aden_p.24_37-0}

After [Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") rule, Aden was ruled by the [Sultanate of Lahej](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Lahej "Sultanate of Lahej"), under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen. The first political intercourse between Lahej and the British took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detachment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into an alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the chief rulers on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.^[\[46\]](#cite_note-:02-46)^{#cite_ref-:02_46-0}

The situation was different in the north of the country, where the [Zaidis](/wiki/Zaydism "Zaydism") did not recognize the authority of the Ottomans and revolted against them many times, the most recent of which was the revolution of [Imam](/wiki/Imams_of_Yemen "Imams of Yemen") *Al-Mansur Billah Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Qasim* , who and his son *Al-Mu'ayyad Billah Muhammad* were able to unite the tribes and expel the Ottomans.^[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)^ The imams relied on the revenues from the port of [Mocha](/wiki/Mokha "Mokha"), and Aden was not as important as the Abadlahs were. At the end of the eighteenth century, Sultan *Fadl al-Abdali* concluded an alliance with the [Yafi](/wiki/Yafa%27a "Yafa'a") tribes to rebel against the Zaidi imams and monopolize Aden's revenues equally among them.^[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)^ The Sultan of [Lahej](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Lahej "Sultanate of Lahej") got rid of the imams, but he did not fulfill his promise to Yafa. The Zaidi imams did not recognize inheritance and saw fighting for the imamate, so the war between *Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Ishaq* and *Al-Mansur Al-Hussein bin Al-Mutawakkil* prolonged, so Al-Abdali took the opportunity to declare his independence in Lahej and Aden.^[\[49\]](#cite_note-Harold_F._Jacob_p.25-49)^ The English had been visiting Aden and Mocha from 1609, led by [Sir Henry Middleton](/wiki/Henry_Middleton_(captain) "Henry Middleton (captain)"), who was imprisoned, his ships confiscated, and eight of his men killed.^[\[50\]](#cite_note-Harold_F._Jacob_p.252-50)^{#cite_ref-Harold_F._Jacob_p.252_50-0}

The British tried to conclude treaties with the Zaidi imams after the Ottomans were expelled from Aden. They visited Sana'a and Mocha, but they treated the British ambassador poorly and rejected his offer. Things were different when the Abdali gained independence from Lahj and Medina. They signed a treaty with the British in 1802, stipulating that they build a factory in Crater and allocate a special cemetery for British subjects free of charge. The Abdali wanted protection from the tribes. Sultan Fadl bin Ali was killed by Yafi' gunmen, then one of the sheikhs of Al-Hujariya invaded Lahj and besieged it for five months. Al-Awaliq also besieged it with eight thousand fighters, and they did not leave until Sultan Ahmed bin Abdul Karim paid them seven thousand dollars.^[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)^ Then the Fadl family attacked Aden in 1836.{#cite_ref-51}

British interests in Aden began in 1796 with [Napoleon](/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon")'s invasion of Egypt, after which a British fleet docked at Aden for several months at the invitation of the sultan. The French were defeated in Egypt in 1801, and their [privateers](/wiki/Privateers "Privateers") were tracked down over the subsequent decade.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^ By 1800, Aden was a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, [Somalis](/wiki/Somalis "Somalis"), Jews, and Indians---housed for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^ As there was little British trade in the Red Sea, most British politicians until the 1830s had no further interest in the area beyond the suppression of piracy. However, a small number of government officials and the [East India Company](/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") officials thought that a British base in the area was necessary to prevent another French advance through Egypt or [Russian expansion through Persia](/wiki/The_Great_Game "The Great Game"). The emergence of [Muhammad Ali of Egypt](/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "Muhammad Ali of Egypt") as a strong local ruler only increased their concerns. The governor of Bombay from 1834 to 1838, [Sir Robert Grant](/wiki/Sir_Robert_Grant "Sir Robert Grant"), was one of those who believed that India could only be protected by preemptively seizing "places of strength" to protect the Indian Ocean.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

The Red Sea increased in importance after the steamship [*Hugh Lindsay*](/wiki/HCS_Hugh_Lindsay_(1829) "HCS Hugh Lindsay (1829)") sailed from Bombay to the Suez isthmus in 1830, stopping at Aden with the sultan's consent to resupply with coal. Although cargo was still carried around the [Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope "Cape of Good Hope") in sailing ships, a steam route to the Suez could provide a much quicker option for transporting officials and important communications. Grant felt that armed ships steaming regularly between Bombay and Suez would help secure British interests in the region and did all he could to progress his vision. After lengthy negotiations due to the costs of investing in the new technology, the government agreed to pay half the costs for six voyages per year and the East India Company board approved the purchase of two new steamers in 1837. Grant immediately announced that monthly voyages to Suez would take place, despite the fact that no secure coal supplying station had been found.^[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)^{#cite_ref-54}

In 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded 194 km^2^ (75 sq mi) including Aden to the [British](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"). On 19 January 1839, the [British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British East India Company") landed [Royal Marines](/wiki/Royal_Marines "Royal Marines") at Aden to secure the territory and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a [free trade](/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade") port, with the liquor, salt, arms, and [opium trades](/wiki/Opium_Wars "Opium Wars") developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from [Mokha](/wiki/Mokha "Mokha").^[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)^ The port lies about equidistant from the [Suez Canal](/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal"), [Bombay](/wiki/Bombay "Bombay"), and [Zanzibar](/wiki/Zanzibar "Zanzibar"), which were all important [British possessions](/wiki/British_possessions "British possessions"). Aden had been an [entrepôt](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t "Entrepôt") and a way-station for ships in the ancient world. There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish [coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") and boiler water. Thus Aden acquired a [coaling station](/wiki/Coaling_Station "Coaling Station") at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until November 1967.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^{#cite_ref-55}

In 1937, the settlement was detached from India and became the [Colony of Aden](/wiki/Aden_Colony "Aden Colony"), a British [Crown colony](/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown colony"). The change in government was a step towards the change in the official currency unit. When [British India](/wiki/British_India "British India") became independent in 1947, Indian [rupees](/wiki/Rupee "Rupee") (divided into [annas](/wiki/Indian_anna "Indian anna")) were replaced in Aden by [East African shillings](/wiki/East_African_shilling "East African shilling"). The [hinterland](/wiki/Hinterland "Hinterland") of Aden and [Hadhramaut](/wiki/Hadhramaut "Hadhramaut") were also loosely tied to Britain as the [Aden Protectorate](/wiki/Aden_Protectorate "Aden Protectorate"), which was overseen from Aden.

Aden's location also made it a useful *[entrepôt](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t "Entrepôt")* for [mail](/wiki/Mail "Mail") passing between places around the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") and Europe.

In order to stabilise Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of [North Yemen](/wiki/Yemen_Arab_Republic "Yemen Arab Republic"), the British attempted gradually to unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the [Federation of Arab Emirates of the South](/wiki/Federation_of_Arab_Emirates_of_the_South "Federation of Arab Emirates of the South") against the wishes of North Yemen. The city became the [State of Aden](/wiki/State_of_Aden "State of Aden") and the Federation was renamed the [Federation of South Arabia](/wiki/Federation_of_South_Arabia "Federation of South Arabia") (FSA).

An insurgency against British administration known as the [Aden Emergency](/wiki/Aden_Emergency "Aden Emergency") began with a grenade attack by the communist [National Liberation Front](/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Yemen) "National Liberation Front (Yemen)") (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a "state of emergency" was declared.^[\[57\]](#cite_note-57)^{#cite_ref-57}

In 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that British troops would remain in Aden. The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY ([Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen](/wiki/Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Occupied_South_Yemen "Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen")) vied for the upper hand.^[\[58\]](#cite_note-58)^{#cite_ref-58}

In January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town. This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. On 20 June 1967, 23 British Army soldiers were ambushed and shot dead by members of Aden Police during the Aden Mutiny in the Crater District. During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an [Aden Airways](/wiki/Aden_Airways "Aden Airways") [DC3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3") plane in the air with no survivors.^[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)^{#cite_ref-59}

The increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated more quickly than initially intended, as recorded in *From Barren Rocks to Living Stones* .^[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)^{#cite_ref-60}

On 30 November 1967, British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control. The [Royal Marines](/wiki/Royal_Marines "Royal Marines"), who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave -- with the exception of a [Royal Engineer](/wiki/Royal_Engineers "Royal Engineers") detachment ([10 Airfields Squadron](/wiki/10th_Field_Squadron_(United_Kingdom) "10th Field Squadron (United Kingdom)") left Aden on 13 December 1967).

The last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the [National Liberation Front](/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(South_Yemen) "National Liberation Front (South Yemen)") had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen, so Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen.^[\[62\]](#cite_note-62)^ Qahtan al-Sha'bi assumed the presidency of the new state, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate of Hadramaut and Al-Mahra were annexed to the new state. Al-Shaabi took over a new country with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, and British support ceased. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 played an important role in the country's economy, as it reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.^[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)^{#cite_ref-63}

The new state was divided into six governorates on December 11, 1967, in order to end the manifestations of tribalism in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms.^[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)^ On March 20, 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership. He was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year, and faced new rebellions from leftist parties in July, August and December of 1968.^[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)^ This is because all Arab countries welcomed the front. National Liberation received a cold reception. Regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the [Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen](/wiki/Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Occupied_South_Yemen "Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen"), where the leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan.^[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)^ They wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.{#cite_ref-66}

Qahtan al-Shaabi dismissed Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham on 16th June, 1969, but the latter, with his ties to the tribes and the army, reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan al-Shaabi, and they were able to place him under house arrest on 22nd June.^[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)^ A presidential committee was formed from Five people: Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister. This group took an extreme leftist line, declaring its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution, and strengthening its relationship with the Soviet Union. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany, and the United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalised foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the country to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist-Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established.^[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)^ The port of Aden was the largest source of national income for the Republic of South Yemen, but the closure of the Suez Canal by Egypt between the years 1967 and 1975 - reduced commercial activities in the port.^[\[69\]](#cite_note-مولد_تلقائيا1-69)^{#cite_ref-مولد_تلقائيا1_69-0}

Salem Rabie Ali wanted to adopt a practical approach, so he communicated with the President of North Yemen, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, and made attempts to restore normal relations with Western countries.

Relations with North Yemen became tense, due to Fattah's support for the factions opposing Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was more fanatical than his predecessors.

Conflicts began within the ruling coalition, and Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh retreated to Aden in August 1993. The general security situation in the country deteriorated, and the complete integration of the two armies failed.

Aden remained in a state of political stagnation for 25 years until President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi took refuge there and carried out his work from the Republican Palace in Aden. Hadi declared Aden the temporary capital on March 7, 2015, instead of Sana'a, which he described as occupied by the Houthis. This was after the Houthis took control of Sanaa on September 21, 2015, and imposed a siege on the Republican Palace and the home of President Hadi on January 20. Hadi submitted his resignation on January 22 to Parliament, which did not hold a session to accept or reject the resignation, and Hadi remained under house arrest imposed by the Houthis. Until he was able to leave for Aden on February 21, 2015, he retracted his resignation, and announced a statement in which he said, "All decisions taken since September 21 are invalid and have no legitimacy."

President [Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi](/wiki/Abd_Rabbuh_Mansur_Hadi "Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi") fled to Aden, his hometown, in February 2015 after being deposed in the [coup d'état](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Yemeni_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état") that many consider to be the start of the [Yemeni civil war](/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)").

#### Pre-independence {#Pre-independence}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aden&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Pre-independence")\]

The first beginning of Adenian sports dates back to the year 1902, when the Adeni Tennis Club was established, with its headquarters in the Al-Qatee' neighborhood in Crater, and Youssef Muhammad Khan founded the "Recreational Club United" in the city of Crater, and it was known as the Yousef Khan Stadium. The city of Aden is considered the first city in which sports were practiced in the Arabian Peninsula, and the first private club in Aden was founded in 1905 under the name "Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club", as the first sports club in Yemen and the Arab world. He was fighting the occupation army divisions and the fleet divisions coming and passing to the port of Aden.^[\[100\]](#cite_note-adenalghad.net-101)^{#cite_ref-adenalghad.net_101-0}

In 1924, the "Al-Husseini Sports Club" was founded in Crater, and a third club appeared in Tawahi under the name "Al-Bamboot Club" and Sheikh Othman. The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a number of clubs. In 1933, the "Nujoom Al-Layl Club", Al-Aidrousi Club, and Nujoom Al-Sabah Club appeared in Crater, and in Tawahi, the "Al-Ittihad Al-Islami Club" (Al-Mawlada) appeared.^[\[101\]](#cite_note-adenalghad.net2-102)^{#cite_ref-adenalghad.net2_102-0}

Until that year, football matches were played in a friendly manner between the teams of the Crater, Al-Tawahi, and Sheikh Othman regions, as there were no federations regulating sports activity. In 1934, the occupation authority announced the establishment of a sports association called the "Adeniya Sports Association", after the increasing number of local clubs. Its members were appointed by the Governor-General of Aden, and all of its members were English, headed by the English Governor of Aden, Bernard Reilly, as sponsor. The association's board of directors consists of Hikam Bottom as president, the Indian Rosario as secretary, and two other members.

This association began holding the first club tournament, which was the "Rosario Cup Championship". Six clubs participated in the tournament, three from Crater (Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi, Al-Husseini, and Nojoom Al-Layl), from Al-Tawahi (Al-Mawalda, and Al-Bamiot), and from Sheikh Othman, Sheikh Othman Club, which includes Players from various small teams in the Sheikh Othman area, and Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi Club won this championship.

Among the most important tournaments held in Aden before independence were the Rosario Cup, the Riley Cup, the Somali Bassem Al-Nar Cup, the Aramco Cup, and the Kik Muncherji Championship.  

### Post-independence {#Post-independence_2}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aden&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Post-independence")\]

After independence, the "Football Federation" was established on January 18, 1968, on the ruins of the "Adeniya Sports Association". The Federation took a decision regarding the Adeniya clubs, which had numbered about 64 sports clubs, reducing and merging the clubs in Aden and Lahj to only 16 clubs, and the clubs were forced to join or unite with large teams. In February 1968, several sports clubs were abolished, leaving only 12 clubs remaining. In December 1968, Al-Islah Club and Al-Shaab Club were merged into one club under the name of the latter in Al-Tawahi. In 1969, the Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club and Al-Tadamon Club were united in [Crater](/wiki/Crater_(Aden) "Crater (Aden)"), under the name Al-Tadamon Al-Muhammadi Club.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

In the "First General Sports Conference" in 1973, the clubs were merged and reduced again, so that their number became only 7 clubs: Al-Ahrar Club, Al-Ahly Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Shaab Club, Al-Hilal Club, United Youth Club, and Aden Tennis Club. On July 18, 1975, the stage of forming urban clubs, and the beginning of the stage of politicization of the clubs in favor of the National Liberation Front, took place. It was decided to change their names and reduce them to become 5 clubs: Al-Tilal Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Minaa Club, Al-Wahda Club, and Al-Shoula Club.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^

On July 18, 1975, the "Al-Tilal Sports Club" appeared, headed by Yassin Saeed Noman, as a new name for the "Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club", which was founded in 1905, and in 1976 the "Yemeni Football Federation" appeared. Al-Tilal Club participated in the "September 26 Cup Competition" in 1980, as the first football competition in which it participated with teams from northern and southern Yemen, such as the national team of Ibb Governorate, Taiz Governorate, Hadhramaut Governorate, Lahj and Hodeidah, at the Shaheed Al-Dharafi Stadium in Sana'a, and Al-Hilal was crowned champion of the September 26 Cup, after victory over Hodeidah national team by five clean goals.^[\[102\]](#cite_note-103)^{#cite_ref-103}

Football is the most popular sport in Aden. There are 9 stadiums in Aden, including the May 22 International Stadium, and 10 sports clubs. In November 2010, Aden hosted the [2010 Arabian Gulf Football Cup](/wiki/20th_Arabian_Gulf_Cup "20th Arabian Gulf Cup").^[\[103\]](#cite_note-104)^{#cite_ref-104}

The industrial activity in Aden is represented by a group of factories and production units, the forefront of which is the oil refinery. The oil refinery in Aden is considered one of the first refineries to be established in the region, and began operating in 1954 AD. The Aden Refineries Company has facilities such as an oil tanker port, a network of storage tanks, and a center to supply ships with fuel.^[\[110\]](#cite_note-الأنشطة_الاقتصادية_لمحافظة_عدن-111)^{#cite_ref-الأنشطة_الاقتصادية_لمحافظة_عدن_111-0}

Historically, Aden was a station for importing goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, Aden was a major commercial center for trade in the Arabian Peninsula, and the port exported small quantities of local products to most Arab ports. Aden provided coal and salt to passing ships, and the port was a stopping point for ships when they entered Bab al-Mandab.

Historically, the port of Aden was the main transport port in the region. Passenger ships land in Al-Tawahi District, and the city is served by Aden International Airport, which is about 10 kilometers (6 mi) from the city. The airport is the main headquarters of Al-Saeeda Airlines and its operations center. The airport is considered the second largest airport. In Yemen, after Sana'a International Airport, it is considered the best airport in Yemen in terms of location due to the mountainous nature of Yemen. However, this airport is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in terms of take-off and landing. The establishment of Aden Airport dates back to the year 1927 when the British forces established a military airport in the district. Khor Maksar. After World War II, Britain carried out extensive urban modernization and built [Aden International Airport](/wiki/Aden_International_Airport "Aden International Airport"), known today, next to the military airport. [Al-Yamda](/wiki/Alyemda "Alyemda") Airlines was the official carrier of South Yemen, before unification, and was based in Aden, before merging with Yemen Airways in 1996. Before the [Battle of Aden Airport](/wiki/Battle_of_Aden_Airport "Battle of Aden Airport") and the [2015 military intervention in Yemen](/wiki/2015_military_intervention_in_Yemen "2015 military intervention in Yemen") closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen.

The city of Aden is a coastal city, as it overlooks a large body of water, the Gulf of Aden, which in turn opens to the Indian Ocean. The shape of the city of Aden in the form of two peninsulas helped this factor to make the city of Aden unique in this particularity, which clearly affected the occurrence of the phenomenon of land and sea breezes. Which occurs due to air exchange between land and water during the day and night. Its location on the water surface also affects the daily and annual temperature range. This does not mean that there are no significant differences in temperatures in summer and winter.^[\[127\]](#cite_note-128)^{#cite_ref-128}

The surface of the city of Aden slopes south, and the highlands appear in the southern part of Aden, represented by the highlands of Jabal Shamsan, whose highest peaks exceed 500 metres, and the highlands of Jabal Ihsan and Jabal Al-Muzalqim in Little Aden, which are lower in height than Jabal Shamsan, and the highlands of Aden do not differ from the rest of the highlands of Yemen in terms of In terms of composition, it is of volcanic origin, and although the mountain highlands occupy large areas of the city, their influence is weak and limited on the climate of the city of Aden.

1. **[\^](#cite_ref-note1_96-0)** Jawad Ali says: It appears from researchers finding writings written in the Musnad in various places in the Arabian Peninsula, including the coasts of the Arabian Gulf, some of which are ancient and some of which are close to Islam, that the Musnad pen was the authentic and first Arabic pen among the Arabs. All the people of the Arabian Peninsula wrote about it, but the Christian preaching that entered the Arabian Peninsula and spread in various places brought with it the late Armenian pen, the pen of the Eastern churches, and began spreading it among the people. Because it was his sacred pen with which the clerics used to write. Since this pen was easier to write than the musnad, it found widespread followers among those who converted to Christianity and among pagans as well, due to its ease of writing. However, it was not able to eliminate the musnad as people continued to write with it. When Islam came, the scribes wrote the revelation with the pen of the people of Mecca so that the revelation would descend among them. The Mecca pen became the official pen for the Muslims, and Al-Musnad was then sentenced to death. He died and was forgotten by the Arabs, until the Orientalists resurrected him and brought him back to existence again, to translate for us the ordinary writings that were recorded in him.
