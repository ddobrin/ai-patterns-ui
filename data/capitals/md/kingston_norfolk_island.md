**Kingston** ([Norf'k](/wiki/Norfuk_language "Norfuk language"): *Daun a'Taun* ^[\[2\]](#cite_note-Buffett-2)^) is the capital and main administrative centre of the [Australian](/wiki/Australia "Australia") external territory of [Norfolk Island](/wiki/Norfolk_Island "Norfolk Island"). The [Norfolk Island Regional Council](/wiki/Norfolk_Island_Regional_Council "Norfolk Island Regional Council") is based in Kingston.^[\[3\]](#cite_note-gov_services_on_norfolk_island-3)^ The settlement is the second-oldest in Australia, having been founded a little over a month after [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney "Sydney"). It is part of the Kingston and Arthur's Vale Historic Area [World Heritage Site](/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site").^[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)^{#cite_ref-4}  

Geography {#Geography}
----------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingston,_Norfolk_Island&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Geography")\]

Kingston is located on the east--west aligned Kingston Plain which rises from the coast to about 20 m (66 ft) above sea level in the [foothills](/wiki/Foothill "Foothill") of the Kingston [escarpment](/wiki/Escarpment "Escarpment"). The [plain](/wiki/Plain "Plain") is 1.5 km (0.9 mi) long by about 500 m (1,640 ft) wide, with calcareous lime sands to the south along the coast and basaltic clays to the north along the foothills. The western end of the plain is marked by the 60 m (197 ft) high Flagstaff Hill. Watermill Creek traverses the plain after leaving Arthur's Vale to the north-west, and is joined by Town Creek and several minor tributaries to form the Kingston swamps before draining into Emily Bay. Most of the accessible beaches on the island are located along the Kingston foreshores. Southwards, Emily Bay and Slaughter Bay open into the Kingston [lagoon](/wiki/Lagoon "Lagoon") and [reefs](/wiki/Reef "Reef") and the broad expanse of Sydney Bay. Eastwards, Cemetery Bay opens directly into the [South Pacific Ocean](/wiki/South_Pacific_Ocean "South Pacific Ocean").  

History {#History}
------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingston,_Norfolk_Island&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")\]

The town was founded on 6 March 1788 by Lieutenant [Philip Gidley King](/wiki/Philip_Gidley_King "Philip Gidley King") and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) who landed that day from HMS *Supply* .^[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)^ They had sailed from [Port Jackson](/wiki/Port_Jackson "Port Jackson") just a few weeks after the establishment of the [British](/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") colony of [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales"). The settlement was initially known as Sidney or Sydney Bay, and by 1796 was being called the Town of Sydney,^[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)^ in honour of [Viscount Sydney](/wiki/Thomas_Townshend,_1st_Viscount_Sydney "Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney"), British [Home Secretary](/wiki/Home_Secretary "Home Secretary") and patron of the [First Fleet](/wiki/First_Fleet "First Fleet"). King established a house on the hill over the town, but the mass of roots in the ground caused him to call it "rooty hill",^[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)^ which name was also later transferred to [Rooty Hill, New South Wales](/wiki/Rooty_Hill,_New_South_Wales "Rooty Hill, New South Wales") when King later established a house there.{#cite_ref-7}  

Urban form {#Urban_form}
------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingston,_Norfolk_Island&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Urban form")\]

The [old town](/wiki/Old_town "Old town") dating from 1788 occupies several winding irregular lanes at the head of Kingston Pier. The modern town, as laid out by the [Royal Engineers](/wiki/Royal_Engineers "Royal Engineers") during the 1830s, consists of a Roman-style [grid plan](/wiki/Grid_plan "Grid plan"). There are two long east west roads: Bay Street along the foreshore and Quality Row, the town's principal thoroughfare, along the foothills. These two [boulevards](/wiki/Boulevard "Boulevard") are connected by short cross streets of Pier Street, Bounty Street, and the former Bligh Street (now part of the drive to [Government House](/wiki/Government_House,_Norfolk_Island "Government House, Norfolk Island")).^[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)^ Stone bridges carry these streets across Watermill Creek. Four roads wind upcountry from the edges of the grid: Country Road, Middlegate Road, Rooty Hill Road, and Driver Christian Road. All the buildings are located either in the [old town](/wiki/Old_town "Old town") or along the Quality Row, with the exception of Government House which is located on a small [knoll](/wiki/Hillock "Hillock") called Dove's Plot Hill. The middle and west of the plain forms the Kingston [Common](/wiki/Common_land "Common land") and Kingston Recreation Ground, with the [golf links](/wiki/Links_(golf) "Links (golf)") occupying the eastern end, and Kingston [Cemetery](/wiki/Cemetery "Cemetery") in the northeast. This broad [greensward](/wiki/Grassland "Grassland") with the Kingston [swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") in its centre separates the two long boulevards.{#cite_ref-8}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingston,_Norfolk_Island&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Municipal governance")\]

Municipal government functions on Norfolk Island are the responsibility of the [Norfolk Island Regional Council](/wiki/Norfolk_Island_Regional_Council "Norfolk Island Regional Council"), based in the New Military Barracks in Kingston.^[\[3\]](#cite_note-gov_services_on_norfolk_island-3)^{#cite_ref-gov_services_on_norfolk_island_3-1}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kingston,_Norfolk_Island&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Nearby towns and hamlets")\]

The town of [Burnt Pine](/wiki/Burnt_Pine "Burnt Pine"), the main commercial and population centre of the island, is about 3 km (1.9 mi) to the northwest, and the [hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet_(place) "Hamlet (place)") of Middlegate is about 2 km (1.2 mi) to the north. The uninhabited [Nepean Island](/wiki/Nepean_Island_(Norfolk_Island) "Nepean Island (Norfolk Island)") and [Phillip Island](/wiki/Phillip_Island_(Norfolk_Island) "Phillip Island (Norfolk Island)") are prominent in the sea view from Kingston.
