[Diego Garcia]

**Diego Garcia** is the largest island of the [Chagos Archipelago](/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago "Chagos Archipelago"), part of the [British Indian Ocean Territory](/wiki/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory "British Indian Ocean Territory") (BIOT). It has been used as a joint UK--U.S. military base since the 1970s, following the [expulsion of the Chagossians](/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Chagossians "Expulsion of the Chagossians") by the UK government. The Chagos Islands have been a [British overseas territory](/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories "British Overseas Territories"), but in early October 2024, the UK engaged in discussions with [Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius "Mauritius") with a view to transfer sovereignty of the islands, while allowing the military base to remain under a 99-year lease, pending a treaty ratification.^[\[3\]](#cite_note-Harding-2024-3)^{#cite_ref-Harding-2024_3-0}

Located just south of the equator in the central [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), Diego Garcia lies 3,535 km (2,197 mi) east of [Tanzania](/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania"), 2,984 km (1,854 mi) east-southeast of [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), 726 km (451 mi) south of the [Maldives](/wiki/Maldives "Maldives"), 1,796 km (1,116 mi) southwest of [India](/wiki/India "India"), 2,877 km (1,788 mi) west-southwest of [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra"), 4,723 km (2,935 mi) northwest of [Australia](/wiki/Australia "Australia"), and 2,112 km (1,312 mi) northeast of [Mauritius Island](/wiki/Mauritius#Mauritius_Island "Mauritius"). Diego Garcia is part of the [Chagos-Laccadive Ridge](/wiki/Chagos%E2%80%93Laccadive_Ridge "Chagos–Laccadive Ridge"), an underwater mountain range^[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)^ that includes the [Lakshadweep](/wiki/Lakshadweep "Lakshadweep"), the [Maldives](/wiki/Maldives "Maldives"), and the other 60 small islands of the Chagos Archipelago. The island observes [UTC+6](/wiki/UTC%2B06:00 "UTC+06:00") year-round.^[\[5\]](#cite_note-USNWorldTimeChart-5)^{#cite_ref-USNWorldTimeChart_5-0}

Diego Garcia was discovered by Portuguese sailors in 1512 and remained uninhabited until the French began using it as a [leper colony](/wiki/Leper_colony "Leper colony") and for [coconut plantations](/wiki/Coconut#Production_and_cultivation "Coconut") in the late 18th century. After the [Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), the island was transferred to British control. It remained part of Mauritius until 1965, when it became part of the newly formed BIOT.

In 1966, Diego Garcia had a population of 924,^[\[6\]](#cite_note-Islanders_v_AG_2003-6)^ mostly contract workers employed in [coconut plantations](/wiki/Copra "Copra"). However, between 1968 and 1973, the Chagossian inhabitants were forcibly removed to make way for the military base. In 2019, the [International Court of Justice](/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice "International Court of Justice") ruled that the UK's administration of the Chagos Archipelago was illegal, a decision supported by the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly"), though the UK has dismissed the ruling as non-binding.{#cite_ref-Islanders_v_AG_2003_6-0}

Diego Garcia remains the only inhabited island of the BIOT, with its population consisting of military personnel and contractors. It is one of two critical U.S. [bomber](/wiki/Bomber "Bomber") bases in the [Indo-Pacific region](/wiki/Indo-Pacific "Indo-Pacific"), alongside [Andersen Air Force Base](/wiki/Andersen_Air_Force_Base "Andersen Air Force Base") in [Guam](/wiki/Guam "Guam").^[\[7\]](#cite_note-thakkar-7)^ It is nicknamed the "Footprint of Freedom" by the [US Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")^[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)^ due to its shape and strategic location in the Indian Ocean.^[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)^{#cite_ref-9}

No tangible evidence exists of people on Diego Garcia before the arrival of Europeans. There is speculation about visits during the [Austronesian](/wiki/Austronesia "Austronesia") diaspora around AD 700, as some say the old Maldivian name for the islands originated from [Malagasy](/wiki/Malagasy_language "Malagasy language"). [Arabs](/wiki/Arab_people "Arab people"), who reached [Lakshadweep](/wiki/Lakshadweep "Lakshadweep") and [Maldives](/wiki/Maldives "Maldives") around AD 900, may have visited the Chagos. Southern Maldivian [oral tradition](/wiki/Oral_tradition "Oral tradition") tells of occasional traders and fishermen marooned on, and later rescued from, Foalhavahi ( ފޯޅަވަހި) Chagos.^[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)^{#cite_ref-10}  

### European arrival {#European_arrival}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: European arrival")\]

The uninhabited islands were [discovered](/wiki/History_of_Portugal_(1415%E2%80%931578)#Chronology_of_the_Portuguese_discoveries "History of Portugal (1415–1578)") by the Portuguese navigator, explorer, and diplomat [Pedro Mascarenhas](/wiki/Pedro_Mascarenhas "Pedro Mascarenhas") in 1512, first named as Dom Garcia, in honour of his patron, Dom [Garcia de Noronha](/wiki/Garcia_de_Noronha "Garcia de Noronha")^[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)^^[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^ when he was detached from the [Portuguese India Armadas](/wiki/Portuguese_India_Armadas "Portuguese India Armadas")^[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^ during his voyage of 1512--1513. Another Portuguese expedition with a Spanish explorer of Andalusian origin, [Diego García de Moguer](/wiki/Diego_Garc%C3%ADa_de_Moguer "Diego García de Moguer"),^[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)^ rediscovered the island in 1544 and named it after himself. Garcia de Moguer died the same year on the return trip to Portugal in the Indian Ocean, off the South African coast. The misnomer "Diego" could have been made unwittingly by the British ever since, as they copied the Portuguese maps. It is assumed^\[*[by whom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")*\]^ that the island was named after one of its first two discoverers---the one by the name of Garcia, the other with name Diego. Also, a [cacography](/wiki/Cacography "Cacography") of the saying *Deo Gracias* (literally 'Thank God') is eligible for the attribution of the [atoll](/wiki/Atoll "Atoll"). Although the [Cantino planisphere](/wiki/Cantino_planisphere "Cantino planisphere") (1504) and the [Ruysch map (1507)](/wiki/Early_world_maps#Ruysch_World_Map_(1507) "Early world maps") clearly delineate the Maldive Islands, giving them the same names, they do not show any islands to the south which can be identified as the Chagos archipelago.{#cite_ref-14}
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Diego_garcian.jpg/170px-Diego_garcian.jpg)](/wiki/File:Diego_garcian.jpg) A [Chagossian](/wiki/Chagossians "Chagossians") photographed by a [US National Geodetic Survey](/wiki/US_National_Geodetic_Survey "US National Geodetic Survey") team in 1969

The [Sebastian Cabot](/wiki/Sebastian_Cabot_(explorer) "Sebastian Cabot (explorer)") map ([Antwerp](/wiki/Antwerp "Antwerp") 1544) shows a number of islands to the south which may be the [Mascarene Islands](/wiki/Mascarene_Islands "Mascarene Islands"). The first map which identifies and names "*Los Chagos* " (in about the right position) is that of [Pierre Desceliers](/wiki/Pierre_Desceliers "Pierre Desceliers") ([Dieppe 1550](/wiki/Dieppe_maps#Existing_Dieppe_maps "Dieppe maps")), although Diego Garcia is not named. An island called "Don Garcia" appears on the *[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum](/wiki/Theatrum_Orbis_Terrarum "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum")* of [Abraham Ortelius](/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius "Abraham Ortelius") (Antwerp 1570), together with "Dos Compagnos", slightly to the north. It may be the case that "Don Garcia" was named after Garcia de Noronha, although no evidence exists to support this.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^ The island is also labelled "Don Garcia" on [Mercator](/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator "Gerardus Mercator")'s *[Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigatium Emendate](/wiki/Early_world_maps#Mercator_world_map_(1569) "Early world maps")* (Duisburg 1569). However, on the *Vera Totius Expeditionis Nauticae Description* of Jodocus Hondius (London 1589), "Don Garcia" mysteriously changes its name to "I. de Dio Gratia", while the "I. de Chagues" appears close by.

The first map to delineate the island under its present name, Diego Garcia, is the *World Map* of [Edward Wright](/wiki/Edward_Wright_(mathematician) "Edward Wright (mathematician)") (London 1599), possibly as a result of misreading Dio (or simply "D.") as Diego, and Gratia as Garcia. The *Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Geographica* of [Hendrik Hondius II](/wiki/Hendrik_Hondius_II "Hendrik Hondius II") (Antwerp 1630) repeats Wright's use of the name, which is then proliferated on all subsequent Dutch maps of the period, and to the present day.  

### Settlement of the island {#Settlement_of_the_island}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Settlement of the island")\]

Diego Garcia and the rest of the Chagos islands were uninhabited until the late 18th century. In 1778, the French Governor of [Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius "Mauritius") granted Monsieur Dupuit de la Faye the island of Diego Garcia, and evidence exists of temporary French visits to collect coconuts and fish.^[\[15\]](#cite_note-Edis_29-15)^ Several Frenchmen living in "a dozen huts" abandoned Diego Garcia when the British [East India Company](/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") attempted to establish a settlement there in April 1786.^[\[15\]](#cite_note-Edis_29-15)^ The supplies of the 275 settlers were overwhelmed by 250 survivors of the wreck of the British East Indian Ship *Atlas* in May, and the colony failed in October.^[\[16\]](#cite_note-Edis_32-16)^ Following the departure of the British, the French colony of Mauritius began marooning [lepers](/wiki/Lepers "Lepers") on the island,^[\[16\]](#cite_note-Edis_32-16)^ and in 1793, the French established a [coconut](/wiki/Coconut "Coconut") plantation using [slave labour](/wiki/Slavery "Slavery"), which exported, too, cordage made from coir (coconut fibre), and [sea cucumbers](/wiki/Sea_cucumber "Sea cucumber") as a far-eastern delicacy.^[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)^{#cite_ref-17}

Diego Garcia became a colony of the UK after the [Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") as part of the [Treaty of Paris (1814)](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1814) "Treaty of Paris (1814)"), and from 1814 to 1965 it was administered from Mauritius;^[\[18\]](#cite_note-Edis_2004,_p._80-18)^ the main plantations were at East Point, the main settlement, Minni Minni, 4.5 km (2.8 mi) north of East Point, and Pointe Marianne, on the western rim, all on the lagoon side of the atoll. The workers lived at each and at villages scattered around the atoll.{#cite_ref-Edis_2004,_p._80_18-0}

From 1881 until 1888, the atoll hosted two [coaling stations](/wiki/Fuelling_station "Fuelling station") for [steamships](/wiki/Steamships "Steamships") crossing the Indian Ocean.^[\[19\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_209_218-19)^{#cite_ref-Stoddart_209_218_19-0}

In 1882, the French-financed, Mauritian-based Société Huilière de Diego et de Peros (the "Oilmaking Company of Diego and Peros"), consolidated all the plantations in the Chagos under its control.^[\[19\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_209_218-19)^{#cite_ref-Stoddart_209_218_19-1}

In 1914, the island was visited by the German light cruiser [SMS *Emden*](/wiki/SMS_Emden "SMS Emden") halfway through its commerce-raiding cruise during the early months of [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I").^[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)^{#cite_ref-20}

In 1942, the British opened RAF Station Diego Garcia and established an advanced flying boat unit at the East Point Plantation, staffed and equipped by [No. 205](/wiki/No._205_Squadron_RAF "No. 205 Squadron RAF") and [No. 240 Squadrons](/wiki/No._240_Squadron_RAF "No. 240 Squadron RAF"), then stationed on Ceylon. Both [Catalina](/wiki/Consolidated_PBY_Catalina "Consolidated PBY Catalina") and [Sunderland](/wiki/Short_Sunderland "Short Sunderland") aircraft were flown during the course of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") in search of Japanese and German submarines and surface raiders. At Cannon Point,^[\[21\]](#cite_note-youtube.com-21)^ two 6-inch naval guns were installed by a [Royal Marines](/wiki/Royal_Marines "Royal Marines") detachment. In February 1942, the mission was to protect the small Royal Navy base and Royal Air Force station located on the island from Japanese attack.^[\[21\]](#cite_note-youtube.com-21)^ Operation of the guns was later taken over by Mauritian and Indian Coastal Artillery troops.^[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)^ Following the conclusion of hostilities, the station was closed on 30 April 1946.^[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)^{#cite_ref-23}

In the early 1960s, the UK was [withdrawing its military presence](/wiki/East_of_Suez#20th_century "East of Suez") from the Indian Ocean, not including the airfield at [RAF Gan](/wiki/RAF_Gan "RAF Gan") to the north of Diego Garcia in the Maldives (which remained open until 1976), and agreed to permit the United States to establish a naval communication station on one of its island territories there. The United States requested an unpopulated island belonging to the UK to avoid political difficulties with newly independent countries, and ultimately the UK and United States agreed that Diego Garcia was a suitable location.^[\[25\]](#cite_note-Sand_3-25)^{#cite_ref-Sand_3_25-0}

To accomplish the UK--US mutual defence strategy, in November 1965, the UK purchased the [Chagos Archipelago](/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago "Chagos Archipelago"), which includes Diego Garcia, from the then self-governing colony of Mauritius for £3 million to create the [British Indian Ocean Territory](/wiki/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory "British Indian Ocean Territory") (BIOT), with the intent of ultimately closing the plantations to provide the uninhabited British territory from which the United States would conduct its military activities in the region.^[\[25\]](#cite_note-Sand_3-25)^{#cite_ref-Sand_3_25-1}

In April 1966, the British government bought the entire assets of the Chagos Agalega Company in the BIOT for £600,000 and administered them as a government enterprise and immediately leased the plantations back to Chagos Agalega while awaiting United States funding of the proposed facilities, with an interim objective of paying for the administrative expenses of the new territory.^[\[24\]](#cite_note-Edis_82-24)^ However, the plantations, both under their previous private ownership and under government administration, proved consistently unprofitable due to the introduction of new oils and lubricants in the international marketplace, and the establishment of vast coconut plantations in the East Indies and the Philippines and the company terminated the lease at the end of 1967.^[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)^{#cite_ref-26}

On 30 December 1966, the United States and the UK executed an agreement through an Exchange of Notes which permitted the United States to use the BIOT for defence purposes for 50 years until December 2016, followed by a 20-year extension (to 2036) as long as neither party gave notice of termination in a two-year window (December 2014 -- December 2016) and the UK may decide on what additional terms to extend the agreement.^[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)^ No monetary payment was made from the United States to the UK as part of this agreement or any subsequent amendment. Rather, the United Kingdom received a US$14-million discount from the United States on the acquisition of submarine-launched [Polaris missiles](/wiki/UGM-27_Polaris "UGM-27 Polaris") per a now-declassified addendum to the 1966 agreement.^[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)^{#cite_ref-28}  

### Arrival of the U.S. Navy {#Arrival_of_the_U.S._Navy}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Arrival of the U.S. Navy")\]

To the United States, Diego Garcia was a prime territory for setting up a foreign military base. According to Stuart Barber---a civilian working for the US Navy at [the Pentagon](/wiki/The_Pentagon "The Pentagon")---Diego Garcia was located far away from any potential threats, it was low in a native population and it was an island that was not sought after by other countries as it lacked economic interest. To Barber, Diego Garcia and other acquired islands would play a key role in maintaining US dominance. Here Barber designed the strategic island concept, where the US would obtain as many less populated islands as possible for military purposes. According to Barber, this was the only way to ensure security for a foreign base. Diego Garcia is often referred to as "Fantasy Island" for its seclusion.
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Seychelles_Governor_inspection_1972.jpg/200px-Seychelles_Governor_inspection_1972.jpg)](/wiki/File:Seychelles_Governor_inspection_1972.jpg) [Sir Bruce Greatbatch](/wiki/Bruce_Greatbatch "Bruce Greatbatch"), [Governor of the Seychelles](/wiki/Governor_of_the_Seychelles "Governor of the Seychelles"), oversaw the [depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago](/wiki/Depopulation_of_Chagossians_from_the_Chagos_Archipelago "Depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago").

The key component in obtaining Diego Garcia was the perceived lack of a native population on the island. Uninhabited until the late 18th century, Diego Garcia had no indigenous population. Its only inhabitants were European overseers who managed the coconut plantations for their absentee landowners and contract workers mostly of African, Indian, and Malay ancestry, known as [Chagossians](/wiki/Chagossians "Chagossians"), who had lived and worked on the plantations for several generations. Prior to setting up a military base, the United States government was informed by the British government---which owned the island---that Diego Garcia had a population of hundreds. The eventual number of Chagossians numbered around 1,000.^[\[29\]](#cite_note-Health_and_Mortality_papers-29)^{#cite_ref-Health_and_Mortality_papers_29-0}

Regardless of the size of the population, the Chagossians had to be removed from the island before the base could be constructed. In 1968, the first tactics were implemented to decrease the population of Diego Garcia. Those who left the island---either for vacation or medical purposes---were not allowed to return, and those who stayed could obtain only restricted food and medical supplies. This tactic was in hope that those that stayed would leave "willingly".^[\[30\]](#cite_note-WashingtonPost-2007-01-01-30)^ One of the tactics used was ordering all Chagossian dogs to be killed.^[\[31\]](#cite_note-murder-31)^{#cite_ref-murder_31-0}

In March 1971, United States Naval [construction battalions](/wiki/Seabee "Seabee") arrived on Diego Garcia to begin the construction of the communications station and an airfield.^[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^ To satisfy the terms of an agreement between the UK and the United States for an uninhabited island, the plantation on Diego Garcia was closed in October of that year.^[\[33\]](#cite_note-Sand_24-33)^ The plantation workers and their families were relocated to the plantations on Peros Banhos and Salomon atolls to the northwest. The by-then-independent Mauritian government refused to accept the islanders without payment, and in 1974, the UK gave the Mauritian government an additional £650,000 to resettle the islanders.^[\[34\]](#cite_note-Sand_25-34)^ Those who still remained on the island of Diego Garcia between 1971 and 1973 were forced onto cargo ships that were heading to Mauritius and the Seychelles.{#cite_ref-Sand_25_34-0}

By 1973, construction of the Naval Communications Station was complete.^[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)^ In the early 1970s, setbacks to United States military capabilities in the region including the [fall of Saigon](/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon "Fall of Saigon"), victory of the [Khmer Rouge](/wiki/Khmer_Rouge "Khmer Rouge") in Cambodia, the closure of the [Peshawar Air Station](/wiki/Peshawar_Air_Station "Peshawar Air Station") listening post in [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan") and [Kagnew Station](/wiki/Kagnew_Station "Kagnew Station") in Eritrea, the [*Mayaguez* incident](/wiki/Mayaguez_incident "Mayaguez incident"), and the build-up of Soviet naval presence in [Aden](/wiki/Aden "Aden") and a Soviet airbase at Berbera, [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), caused the United States to request, and the UK to approve, permission to build a fleet anchorage and enlarged airfield on Diego Garcia,^[\[36\]](#cite_note-Edis_90-36)^ and the Seabees doubled the number of workers constructing these facilities.^[\[36\]](#cite_note-Edis_90-36)^{#cite_ref-Edis_90_36-1}

Following the fall of the [Shah of Iran](/wiki/Shah_of_Iran "Shah of Iran") and the [Iran Hostage Crisis](/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis "Iran hostage crisis") in 1979--1980, the West became concerned with ensuring the flow of oil from the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf") through the [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz"), and the United States received permission for a $400-million expansion of the military facilities on Diego Garcia consisting of two parallel 12,000-foot-long (3,700 m) runways, expansive parking aprons for heavy bombers, 20 new anchorages in the lagoon, a deep-water pier, port facilities for the largest naval vessels in the U.S. and British fleets, aircraft hangars, maintenance buildings and an air terminal, a 1,340,000 barrels (213,000 m^3^) fuel storage area, and [billeting](/wiki/Billet "Billet") and messing facilities for thousands of sailors and support personnel.^[\[36\]](#cite_note-Edis_90-36)^ The closure of the U.S. bases in the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines "Philippines") in the early 1990s brought many workers from [Subic Bay](/wiki/U.S._Naval_Base_Subic_Bay "U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay") and [Clark Air Base](/wiki/Clark_Air_Base "Clark Air Base") to Diego Garcia.^[\[37\]](#cite_note-37)^{#cite_ref-37}

On 23 June 2017, the [United Nations General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly") (UNGA) voted in favour of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK to the [International Court of Justice](/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice "International Court of Justice") (ICJ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean.

On 1 April 2010, the [Chagos Marine Protected Area](/wiki/Chagos_Marine_Protected_Area "Chagos Marine Protected Area") (MPA) was declared to cover the waters around the Chagos Archipelago. However, Mauritius objected, stating this was contrary to its legal rights, and on 18 March 2015, in light of the *[Mauritius v. United Kingdom](/wiki/Mauritius_v._United_Kingdom "Mauritius v.

The joint base on the island will stay, with the UK initially taking a 99 year lease of the base from Mauritius. Mauritius will be allowed to begin resettlement on the Chagos Archipelago, but not on Diego Garcia due to the sensitive nature of the base.

Diego Garcia had no permanent inhabitants when discovered by the Spanish explorer Diego García de Moguer in the 16th century, then in the service of Portugal, and this remained the case until it was settled as a French colony in 1793.^[\[19\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_209_218-19)^{#cite_ref-Stoddart_209_218_19-2}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: French settlement")\]  
Main article: [Chagossians](/wiki/Chagossians "Chagossians")

Most inhabitants of Diego Garcia through the period 1793--1971 were plantation workers, but also included Franco-Mauritian managers, Indo-Mauritian administrators, Mauritian and Seychellois contract employees, and in the late 19th century, Chinese and Somali employees.

A distinct Creole culture called the [Îlois](/wiki/%C3%8Elois "Îlois"), which means "islanders" in [French Creole](/wiki/French-based_creole_languages "French-based creole languages"), evolved from these workers. The Îlois, now called Chagos Islanders or Chagossians since the late-1990s, were descended primarily from [slaves](/wiki/Slaves "Slaves") brought to the island from [Madagascar](/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar") by the French between 1793 and 1810, and [Malay](/wiki/Malay_race "Malay race") slaves from the slave market on [Pulo Nyas](/wiki/Nias_Island "Nias Island"), an island off the northwest coast of [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra"), from around 1820 until the slave trade ended following the [Slavery Abolition Act 1833](/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833 "Slavery Abolition Act 1833").^[\[48\]](#cite_note-reefnewmedia.co.uk-48)^ The Îlois also evolved a French-based [Creole dialect](/wiki/Mauritian_Creole "Mauritian Creole") now called [Chagossian Creole](/wiki/Chagossian_Creole "Chagossian Creole").{#cite_ref-reefnewmedia.co.uk_48-0}

Throughout their recorded history, the plantations of the Chagos Archipelago had a population of approximately 1,000 individuals, about two-thirds of whom lived on Diego Garcia. A peak population of 1,142 on all islands was recorded in 1953.^[\[29\]](#cite_note-Health_and_Mortality_papers-29)^{#cite_ref-Health_and_Mortality_papers_29-1}

The primary industry throughout the island's colonial period consisted of coconut [plantations](/wiki/Plantations "Plantations") producing [copra](/wiki/Copra "Copra") and/or [coconut oil](/wiki/Coconut_oil "Coconut oil"),^[\[19\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_209_218-19)^ until closure of the plantations and forced relocation of the inhabitants in October 1971.

Main article: [Expulsion of the Chagossians](/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Chagossians "Expulsion of the Chagossians")

All the inhabitants of Diego Garcia were forcibly resettled to other islands in the Chagos Archipelago, Mauritius or Seychelles by 1971 to satisfy the requirements of a UK/United States Exchange of Notes signed in 1966 to depopulate the island when the United States constructed a base upon it.^[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)^ No current agreement exists on how many of the evacuees met the criteria to be an Îlois, and thus be an indigenous person at the time of their removal, but the UK and Mauritian governments agreed in 1972 that 426 families,^[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)^ numbering 1,151 individuals,^[\[34\]](#cite_note-Sand_25-34)^ were due compensation payments as exiled Îlois.

Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island in the British Indian Ocean Territory, an [overseas territory of the United Kingdom](/wiki/Overseas_territory_of_the_United_Kingdom "Overseas territory of the United Kingdom"), usually abbreviated as "BIOT". The [Government of the BIOT](/wiki/Government_of_the_British_Indian_Ocean_Territory "Government of the British Indian Ocean Territory") consists of a [commissioner](/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_British_Indian_Ocean_Territory "Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory") appointed by [King Charles III](/wiki/King_Charles_III "King Charles III"). The commissioner is based in London, resident in the [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office](/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office") (FCDO), and is assisted by an administrator and small staff.

Originally colonised by the French, Diego Garcia was ceded, along with the rest of the Chagos Archipelago, to the United Kingdom in the Treaty of Paris (1814) at the conclusion of a portion of the Napoleonic Wars.^[\[19\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_209_218-19)^ Diego Garcia and the Chagos Archipelago were administered by the colonial government on the island of [Mauritius](/wiki/British_Mauritius "British Mauritius") until 1965, when the UK purchased them from the self-governing colony of Mauritius for £3 million, and declared them to be a separate [British Overseas Territory](/wiki/British_Overseas_Territory "British Overseas Territory").^[\[62\]](#cite_note-Edis_84-62)^ The BIOT administration was moved to [Seychelles](/wiki/Seychelles "Seychelles") following the independence of Mauritius in 1968 until the independence of Seychelles in 1976,^[\[18\]](#cite_note-Edis_2004,_p._80-18)^ and to a desk in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London since.^[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)^{#cite_ref-63}  

### Military administration {#Military_administration}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Military administration")\]

The UK represents the territory internationally. A local government as normally envisioned does not exist.^[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)^ Rather, the administration is represented in the territory by the officer commanding British Forces on Diego Garcia, the "Brit rep". Laws and regulations are promulgated by the commissioner and enforced in the BIOT by Brit rep.{#cite_ref-64}

Of major concern to the BIOT administration is the relationship with the United States military forces resident on Diego Garcia. An annual meeting called "The Pol-Mil Talks" (for "political-military") of all concerned is held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to resolve pertinent issues. These resolutions are formalised by an "Exchange of Letters".^[\[33\]](#cite_note-Sand_24-33)^{#cite_ref-Sand_24_33-1}

Neither the US nor the UK recognises Diego Garcia as being subject to the [African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty](/wiki/African_Nuclear_Weapons_Free_Zone_Treaty "African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty"), which lists BIOT as covered by the treaty.^[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)^^[\[66\]](#cite_note-10.1093/jel/eqn034-66)^^[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)^ It is not publicly known whether [nuclear weapons](/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") have ever been stored on the island.^[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)^ [Noam Chomsky](/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") and Peter Sand have observed and emphasised that the US and UK stance is blocking the implementation of the treaty.^[\[69\]](#cite_note-69)^^[\[70\]](#cite_note-70)^{#cite_ref-70}  

### Transnational political issues {#Transnational_political_issues}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Transnational political issues")\]

There are two transnational political issues which affect Diego Garcia and the BIOT, through the British government.

* The island state of Mauritius claims the Chagos Archipelago (which is conterminous with the BIOT), including Diego Garcia. A subsidiary issue is the Mauritian opposition to the UK Government's declaration of 1 April 2010 that the BIOT is a marine protected area with fishing and [extractive industry](/wiki/Extractivism "Extractivism") (including oil and gas exploration) prohibited.^[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)^{#cite_ref-71}
* The issue of compensation and repatriation of the former inhabitants, [exiled since 1973](/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Chagossians "Expulsion of the Chagossians"), continues in litigation and as of August 2010 had been submitted to the European Court of Human Rights by a group of former residents.^[\[72\]](#cite_note-72)^ Some^\[*[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")*\]^ groups allege that Diego Garcia and its territorial waters out to 3 nautical miles (6 km) have been restricted from public access without permission of the BIOT Government since 1971.^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^{#cite_ref-72}

On 3 November 2022, the British Foreign Secretary [James Cleverly](/wiki/James_Cleverly "James Cleverly") announced that the UK and Mauritius had decided to begin negotiations on sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, taking into account international legal proceedings.

He said that he had heard from three US intelligence sources that Diego Garcia was used as "a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time" and, "What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment".^[\[75\]](#cite_note-guardian-20150130-75)^^[\[76\]](#cite_note-telegraph-20150130-76)^{#cite_ref-telegraph-20150130_76-0}

According to [leaked diplomatic cables](/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak "United States diplomatic cables leak"), in a calculated move planned in 2009, the UK proposed that the BIOT become a "marine reserve" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to the islands. A summary of the diplomatic cable is as follows:^[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)^^[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)^{#cite_ref-87}
[HMG](/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Government "Her Majesty's Government") would like to establish a "marine park" or "reserve" providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on 12 May. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park---the world's largest---would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and United States should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that United States interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT's former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.  

Natural history {#Natural_history}

No species of plant, bird, amphibian, reptile, mollusc, crustacean or mammal is [endemic](/wiki/Endemism "Endemism") on Diego Garcia or the surrounding waters, though some species of fish and aquatic invertebrates are endemic. All plants, wildlife, and aquatic species are protected to some degree.

Much of the lagoon and other waters of Diego Garcia are protected wetlands, following an application by the UK in 2004 to obtain [Ramsar site](/wiki/Ramsar_site "Ramsar site") wetlands conservation status,^[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)^ and large parts of the island are nature preserves.^[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)^{#cite_ref-89}

Diego Garcia is the largest land mass in the Chagos Archipelago (which includes [Peros Banhos](/wiki/Peros_Banhos "Peros Banhos"), the [Salomon Islands](/wiki/Salomon_Islands "Salomon Islands"), the [Three Brothers](/wiki/Three_Brothers_(islands),_Chagos "Three Brothers (islands), Chagos"), the [Egmont Islands](/wiki/Egmont_Islands "Egmont Islands"), and the [Great Chagos Bank](/wiki/Great_Chagos_Bank "Great Chagos Bank")), being an atoll occupying approximately 174 square kilometres (67 sq mi), of which 27.19 square kilometres (10 sq mi) is dry land.^[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)^ The continuous portion of the atoll rim stretches 64 km (40 mi) from one end to the other, enclosing a lagoon 21 km (13 mi) long and up to 11 km (7 mi) wide, with a 6 km (4 mi) pass opening at the north. Three small islands are located in the pass.^[\[91\]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-91)^{#cite_ref-ReferenceA_91-0}

The island consists of the largest continuous dryland rim of all atolls in the world. The dryland rim varies in width from a few hundred metres to 2.4 km. Typical of coral atolls, it has a maximum elevation on some dunes on the ocean side of the rim of 9 m (30 ft) above mean low water. The rim nearly encloses a lagoon about 19 km (12 mi) long and up to 8 km (5.0 mi) wide. The atoll forms a nearly complete rim of land around a lagoon, enclosing 90% of its [perimeter](/wiki/Perimeter "Perimeter"), with an opening only in the north. The main island is the largest of about 60 islands which form the Chagos Archipelago. Besides the main island, three small islets are at the mouth of the lagoon: West Island (3.4 ha (8.4 acres)), Middle Island (6 ha (15 acres)) and East Island (11.75 ha (29.0 acres)). A fourth, Anniversary Island, 1 km (1,100 [yards](/wiki/Yards "Yards")) southwest of Middle Island, appears as just a sand bar on satellite images. Both Middle Island and Anniversary Island are part of the Spur Reef complex.^[\[91\]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-91)^{#cite_ref-ReferenceA_91-1}

The total area of the atoll is about 170 km^2^ (66 sq mi). The lagoon area is roughly 120 km^2^ (46 sq mi) with depths ranging down to about 25 m (82 ft). The total land area (excluding peripheral reefs) is around 30 km^2^ (12 sq mi). The coral reef surrounding the seaward side of the atoll is generally broad, flat, and shallow around 1 m (3.3 ft) below mean sea level in most locations and varying from 100 to 200 m (330 to 660 ft) in width. This fringing seaward reef shelf comprises an area around 35.2 km^2^ (14 sq mi). At the outer edge of the reef shelf, the bottom slopes very steeply into deep water, at some locations dropping to more than 450 m (1,500 ft) within 1 km (0.62 mi) of the shore.^[\[91\]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-91)^{#cite_ref-ReferenceA_91-2}

In the lagoon, numerous coral heads present hazards to navigation. The shallow reef shelf surrounding the island on the ocean side offers no ocean-side anchorage. The channel and anchorage areas in the northern half of the lagoon are [dredged](/wiki/Dredge "Dredge"), along with the pre-1971 ship [turning basin](/wiki/Turning_basin "Turning basin"). Significant saltwater wetlands called [barachois](/wiki/Barachois "Barachois") exist in the southern half of the lagoon. These small lagoons off of the main lagoon are filled with [seawater](/wiki/Seawater "Seawater") at high tide and dry at low tide. Scientific expeditions in 1996 and 2006 described the lagoon and surrounding waters of Diego Garcia, along with the rest of the Chagos Archipelago, as "exceptionally unpolluted" and "pristine".^[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)^{#cite_ref-92}

Diego Garcia is frequently subject to earthquakes caused by [tectonic plate](/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics") movement along the [Carlsberg Ridge](/wiki/Carlsberg_Ridge "Carlsberg Ridge") located just to the west of the island. One was recorded in 1812; one measuring 7.6 on the Richter Scale hit on 30 November 1983, at 23:46 local time and lasted 72 seconds, resulting in minor damage including wave damage to a 50-m stretch of the southern end of the island, and another on 2 December 2002, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale struck the island at 12:21 am.^[\[93\]](#cite_note-realhistory-93)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^{#cite_ref-realhistory_93-0}

In December 2004, [a tsunami generated near Indonesia](/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami "2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami") caused minor shoreline erosion on Barton Point (the northeast point of the atoll of Diego Garcia).^[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)^{#cite_ref-94}

### Fresh water supply {#Fresh_water_supply}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diego_Garcia&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Fresh water supply")\]

Diego Garcia is the above-water rim of a coral atoll composed of [Holocene](/wiki/Holocene "Holocene") coral rubble and sand to the depth of about 36 m (118 ft), overlaying [Pleistocene](/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene") limestone deposited at the then-sea level on top of a [seamount](/wiki/Seamount "Seamount") rising about 1,800 m (5,900 ft) from the floor of the Indian Ocean. The Holocene sediments are porous and completely saturated with sea water. Any rain falling on the above-water rim quickly percolates through the surface sand and encounters the salt water underneath. Diego Garcia is of sufficient width to minimise tidal fluctuations in the [aquifer](/wiki/Aquifer "Aquifer"), and the rainfall (in excess of 102.5 inches/260 cm per year on average)^[\[96\]](#cite_note-96)^ is sufficient in amount and periodicity for the fresh water to form a series of convex, freshwater, [Ghyben-Herzberg lenses](/wiki/Ghyben-Herzberg_lenses "Ghyben-Herzberg lenses") floating on the heavier salt water in the saturated sediments.^[\[97\]](#cite_note-bare_url-97)^^[\[98\]](#cite_note-Urish-98)^{#cite_ref-Urish_98-0}

The horizontal structure of each lens is influenced by variations in the type and porosity of the subsurface deposits, which on Diego Garcia are minor. At depth, the lens is globular; near the surface, it generally conforms to the shape of the island.^[\[99\]](#cite_note-99)^ When a Ghyben-Herzberg lens is fully formed, its floating nature will push a [freshwater head](/wiki/Hydraulic_head "Hydraulic head") above [mean sea level](/wiki/Mean_sea_level "Mean sea level"), and if the island is wide enough, the depth of the lens below mean sea level will be 40 times the height of the water table above sea level. On Diego Garcia, this equates to a maximum depth of 20 m. However, the actual size and depth of each lens is dependent on the width and shape of the island at that point, the permeability of the aquifer, and the equilibrium between recharging rainfall and losses to evaporation to the atmosphere, transpiration by plants, tidal advection, and human use.{#cite_ref-99}

In the plantation period, shallow wells, supplemented by rainwater collected in [cisterns](/wiki/Cistern "Cistern"), provided sufficient water for the pastoral lifestyle of the small population. On Diego Garcia today, the military base uses over 100 shallow "horizontal" wells to produce over 560,000 L per day from the "Cantonment" lens on the northwest arm of the island---sufficient water for western-style usage for a population of 3,500. This 3.7 km^2^ lens holds an estimated 19 million m^3^ of fresh water and has an average daily recharge from rainfall over 10,000 m^3^, of which 40% remains in the lens and 60% is lost through [evapotranspiration](/wiki/Evapotranspiration "Evapotranspiration").^[\[100\]](#cite_note-100)^{#cite_ref-100}

Extracting fresh water from a lens for human consumption requires careful calculation of the sustainable yield of the lens by season because each lens is susceptible to corruption by [saltwater intrusion](/wiki/Saltwater_intrusion "Saltwater intrusion") caused by overuse or drought. In addition, overwash by tsunamis and tropical storms has corrupted lenses in the Maldives and several Pacific islands. Vertical wells can cause salt upcoming into the lens, and overextraction will reduce freshwater pressure resulting in lateral intrusion by seawater. Because the porosity of the surface soil results in virtually zero runoff, lenses are easily polluted by fecal waste, burials, and chemical spills. Corruption of a lens can take years to "flush out" and reform, depending on the ratio of recharge to losses.^[\[97\]](#cite_note-bare_url-97)^{#cite_ref-bare_url_97-1}

A few natural depressions on the atoll rim capture the abundant rainfall to form areas of freshwater wetlands.^[\[101\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_127_142-101)^ Two are of significance to island wildlife and to recharge their respective freshwater lenses. One of these is centred on the northwest point of the atoll; another is found near the Point Marianne Cemetery on the southeast end of the airfield. Other, smaller freshwater wetlands are found along the east side of the runway, and in the vicinity of the receiver antenna field on the northwest arm of the atoll.^[\[102\]](#cite_note-102)^{#cite_ref-102}

Also, several man-made freshwater ponds resulted from excavations made during construction of the airfield and road on the western half of the atoll rim. These fill from rainfall and from extending into the Ghyben-Herzberg lenses found on this island.^[\[103\]](#cite_note-103)^{#cite_ref-103}

Diego Garcia has an equatorial [tropical rainforest climate](/wiki/Tropical_rainforest_climate "Tropical rainforest climate") ([Köppen](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") *Af* ). The surrounding sea surface temperature is the primary climatic control, and temperatures are generally uniform throughout the year, with an average maximum of 30 °C (86 °F) by day during March and April, and 29 °C (84 °F) from July to September. Diurnal variation is roughly 3--4 °C (5.4--7.2 °F), falling to the low 27 °C (81 °F) by night.^[\[104\]](#cite_note-NAVCENT_2002-104)^ Humidity is high throughout the year. The almost constant breeze keeps conditions reasonably comfortable.{#cite_ref-NAVCENT_2002_104-0}

From December through March, winds are generally westerly around 6 knots (11 km/h). During April and May, winds are light and variable, ultimately backing to an east-southeasterly direction. From June through September, the influence of the Southeast trades is felt, with speeds of 10--15 knots. During October and November, winds again go through a period of light and variable conditions veering to a westerly direction with the onset of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.^[\[104\]](#cite_note-NAVCENT_2002-104)^{#cite_ref-NAVCENT_2002_104-1}

All [precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)") falls as [rain](/wiki/Rainfall "Rainfall"), characterised by air mass-type showers. Annual rainfall averages 2,603.5 mm (102.50 in), with the heaviest precipitation from September to April. January is the wettest month with 353 mm (13.9 in) of mean monthly precipitation, and August the driest month, averaging 106.5 mm (4.19 in) of mean monthly precipitation.^[\[104\]](#cite_note-NAVCENT_2002-104)^{#cite_ref-NAVCENT_2002_104-2}

[Thunderstorm](/wiki/Thunderstorm "Thunderstorm") activity is generally noticed in the afternoon and evening during the summer months (December through March), when the [Intertropical Convergence Zone](/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone "Intertropical Convergence Zone") is in the vicinity of the island.^[\[104\]](#cite_note-NAVCENT_2002-104)^{#cite_ref-NAVCENT_2002_104-3}

Diego Garcia is at minimum risk from [tropical cyclones](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") due to its proximity to the [equator](/wiki/Equator "Equator") where the [coriolis parameter](/wiki/Coriolis_effect "Coriolis effect") required to organise circulation of the [upper atmosphere](/wiki/Upper_atmosphere "Upper atmosphere") is minimal. Low-intensity storms have hit the island, including one in 1901, which blew over 1,500 coconut trees;^[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)^ one on 16 September 1944,^[\[106\]](#cite_note-106)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^ which caused the wreck of a Royal Air Force PBY Catalina; one in September 1990 which demolished the tent city then being constructed for United States Air Force bomber crews during Operation Desert Storm;^[\[93\]](#cite_note-realhistory-93)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^ and one on 22 July 2007, when winds exceeded 60 kn (110 km/h) and over 250 mm (9.8 in) of rain fell in 24 hours.^[\[93\]](#cite_note-realhistory-93)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^{#cite_ref-realhistory_93-2}

The island was somewhat affected by the [tsunami](/wiki/Tsunami "Tsunami") caused by the [2004 Indian Ocean earthquake](/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake "2004 Indian Ocean earthquake"). Service personnel on the western arm of the island reported only a minor increase in wave activity. The island was protected to a large degree by its favourable [ocean topography](/wiki/Ocean_topography "Ocean topography"). About 80 km (50 mi) east of the atoll lies the 650-km-long (400-mile) Chagos Trench, an underwater canyon plunging more than 4,900 m (16,100 ft). The depth of the trench and its grade to the atoll's slope and shelf shore makes it more difficult for substantial tsunami waves to build before passing the atoll from the east. In addition, near-shore [coral reefs](/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef") and an algal platform may have dissipated much of the waves' impact.^[\[107\]](#cite_note-107)^^[\[108\]](#cite_note-chagosnews-108)^ A biological survey conducted in early 2005 indicated erosional effects of the tsunami wave on Diego Garcia and other islands of the Chagos Archipelago. One 200-to-300 m (220-to-330 yd) stretch of shoreline was found to have been breached by the tsunami wave, representing about 10% of the eastern arm. A biological survey by the Chagos Conservation Trust reported that the resulting inundation additionally washed away shoreline shrubs and small to medium-sized coconut palms.^[\[108\]](#cite_note-chagosnews-108)^{#cite_ref-chagosnews_108-1}

The first [botanical](/wiki/Botanical "Botanical") observations of the island were made by Hume in 1883, when the coconut plantations had been in operation for a full century. Subsequent studies and collections during the plantation era were made in 1885, 1905, 1939, and 1967.^[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)^ Thus, very little of the nature of the precontact vegetation is known.{#cite_ref-111}

The 1967 survey, published by the [Smithsonian](/wiki/Smithsonian "Smithsonian")^[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)^ is used as the most authoritative baseline for more recent research. These studies indicate the vegetation of the island may be changing rapidly. For example, J. M. W. Topp collected data annually between 1993 and 2003 and found that on the average three new plant species arrived each year, mainly on Diego Garcia. His research added fully a third more species to Stoddart.^[\[113\]](#cite_note-113)^ Topp and Martin Hamilton of [Kew Gardens](/wiki/Kew_Gardens "Kew Gardens") compiled the most recent checklist of vegetation in 2009.^[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)^{#cite_ref-114}

In 1967, Stoddart described the land area of Diego Garcia as having a [littoral](/wiki/Littoral_zone "Littoral zone") [hedge](/wiki/Hedge "Hedge") of *[Scaevola taccada](/wiki/Scaevola_taccada "Scaevola taccada")* , while inland, *[Cocos nucifera](/wiki/Coconut "Coconut")* (coconut) was the most dominant tree, covering most of the island. The substory was either managed and park-like, with understory less than 0.5 m in height, or consisted of what he called "Cocos Bon-Dieu" -- an intermediate story of juvenile trees and a luxuriant ground layer of self-sown seedlings -- causing those areas to be relatively impenetrable.^[\[115\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_143_160-115)^{#cite_ref-Stoddart_143_160_115-0}

Also, areas of remnant tropical hardwood forest are at the sites of the plantation-era villages, as well as *[Casuarina equisetifolia](/wiki/Casuarina_equisetifolia "Casuarina equisetifolia")* (iron wood pines) woodlands.^[\[101\]](#cite_note-Stoddart_127_142-101)^{#cite_ref-Stoddart_127_142_101-1}

In 1997, the United States Navy contracted a vegetation survey that identified about 280 species of terrestrial [vascular plants](/wiki/Vascular_plant "Vascular plant") on Diego Garcia.^[\[116\]](#cite_note-116)^ None of these was [endemic](/wiki/Endemism "Endemism"), and another survey in 2005 identified just 36 species as "native", meaning arriving without the assistance of humans, and found elsewhere in the world.^[\[117\]](#cite_note-117)^ No [terrestrial plant](/wiki/Terrestrial_plant "Terrestrial plant") species are of any conservation-related concern at present.^[\[118\]](#cite_note-118)^{#cite_ref-118}

Another three tree species are common, and may be native, but they may also have been introduced by humans: *Casuarina equisetifolia* , *[Hibiscus tiliaceus](/wiki/Hibiscus_tiliaceus "Hibiscus tiliaceus")* , and *[Pipturus argenteus](/wiki/Pipturus "Pipturus")*.{#cite_ref-120}

The five native shrubs are: *[Caesalpinia bonduc](/wiki/Caesalpinia_bonduc "Caesalpinia bonduc")* , *[Pemphis acidula](/wiki/Pemphis "Pemphis")* , *[Premna serratifolia](/wiki/Premna "Premna")* , *Scaevola taccada* (often mispronounced "Scaveola"), and *[Suriana maritima](/wiki/Suriana "Suriana")*.

Also, 134 species of plants are classified as "weedy" or "naturalised alien species", being those unintentionally introduced by man, or intentionally introduced as ornamentals or crop plants which have now "gone native", including 32 new species recorded since 1995, indicating a very rapid rate of introduction.^[\[121\]](#cite_note-121)^ The remainder of the species list consists of cultivated food or ornamental species, grown in restricted environments such as a planter's pot.^[\[122\]](#cite_note-122)^{#cite_ref-122}

In 2004, 10 [plant communities](/wiki/Plant_community "Plant community") were recognised on the atoll rim:^[\[91\]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-91)^{#cite_ref-ReferenceA_91-3}

* *Calophyllum* forest, dominated by *Calophyllum inophyllum* , with trunks that can grow in excess of 2 metres (6.6 ft) in diameter. This forest often contains other species such as *Hernandia sonora* , *Cocos nucifera* , and *Guettarda speciosa* with a *Premna obtusifolia* edge. When found on the beaches, *Calophyllum* often extends over the lagoon water and supports nesting red-footed boobies, as does *Barringtonia asiatica* found mostly on the eastern arm of the atoll.
* *Cocos* forest, essentially monotypic (*Cocos bon Dieu*), with the understory consisting of coconut seedlings
* *Cocos-Hernandia* forest, dominated by two canopy species---*C. nucifera* and *H. sonora*
* *Cocos-Guettarda* forest, dominated by the canopy species *C. nucifera* and *G. speciosa* : The understory consists of a mix of *Neisosperma oppositifolium* , with *Scaevola taccada* and *Tournefortia argentea* on the beach edge.
* *Hernandia* forest, dominated at the canopy level by *H. sonora* : The most representative areas of this forest type are on the eastern, undeveloped part of the atoll. *Calophyllum inophyllum* and *C. nucifera* are often present. Understory species in this forest are often *Morinda citrifolia* , *Cocos* seedlings, and *[Asplenium nidus](/wiki/Asplenium_nidus "Asplenium nidus")* (bird's nest fern), and occasionally, *N. oppositifolium* and *G. speciosa*.
* *Premna* shrubland, occurring generally between marshy areas and forested areas: The most conspicuous vegetation is primarily *P. obtusifolia* , with *Casuarina equisetifolia* and *Scaevola taccada* on the margins. The dense groundcover consists of species such as *[Fimbristylis cymosa](/wiki/Fimbristylis "Fimbristylis")* , *[Ipomoea pes-caprae](/wiki/Ipomoea_pes-caprae "Ipomoea pes-caprae")* (beach morning glory) and *[Triumfetta procumbens](/wiki/Triumfetta "Triumfetta")* . *Premna* shrubland appears mostly adjacent to the developed areas of the atoll, particularly in the well fields.
* Littoral scrub lines almost the entire seashore and lagoon shore of the island. It is dominated by *S. taccada* , but it also contains scattered coconut trees, *G. speciosa* and *Pisonia grandis* . On the seaward side, it also contains *Tournefortia argentea* and *Suriana maritima* . On the lagoon side, it may also contain *[Lepturus repens](/wiki/Lepturus "Lepturus")* , *[Triumfetta procumbens](/wiki/Triumfetta "Triumfetta")* and *[Cyperus ligularis](/wiki/Cyperus "Cyperus")* . Large pockets of *Barringtonia asiatica* are also on the eastern edge of the lagoon.
* Maintained areas of grasses and sedges routinely mowed: Aerial photographs of the island clearly display large areas of grasslands and park-like [savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") upon which the United States military has constructed large outdoor facilities such as antenna fields and the airport.^[\[123\]](#cite_note-123)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^{#cite_ref-123}
* Mixed native forest, with no dominant canopy species
* Marshes are divided into three different types: cattail (*[Typha domingensis](/wiki/Typha_domingensis "Typha domingensis")*), wetland, and mixed species. Cattail marshes contained almost entirely cattails. These areas are often man-made reservoirs or drainages that have been almost entirely monotypic. Wetlands were based upon vegetation that occurred in the area with fresh water. Mixed-species marshes were highly variable and usually had no standing water.

Diego Garcia provides suitable foraging and nesting habitat for both the hawksbill turtle (*[Eretmochelys imbricata](/wiki/Eretmochelys_imbricata "Eretmochelys imbricata")* ) and the green turtle (*[Chelonia mydas](/wiki/Chelonia_mydas "Chelonia mydas")* ). Juvenile hawksbills are quite common in the lagoon and at Barachois Sylvane (also known as Turtle Cove) in the southern part of the lagoon. Adult hawksbills and greens are common in the surrounding seas and nest regularly on the ocean-side beaches of the atoll. Hawksbills have been observed nesting during June and July, and from November to March. Greens have been observed nesting in every month; the average female lays three clutches per season, each having an average clutch size of 113 eggs. [Diurnal](/wiki/Diurnality "Diurnality") nesting is common in both species. An estimated 300--700 hawksbills and 400--800 greens nest in the Chagos.^[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)^{#cite_ref-133}

All consumable food and equipment are brought to Diego Garcia by sea or air, and all non-biodegradable waste is shipped off the island as well. From 1971 to 1973, United States Navy LSTs provided this service. Beginning in 1973, civilian ships were contracted to provide these services. From 2004 to 2009, the US-flagged [container ship](/wiki/Container_ship "Container ship") [MV *Baffin Strait*](/wiki/MV_Baffin_Strait_(T-AK_W9519) "MV Baffin Strait (T-AK W9519)"), often referred to as the "DGAR shuttle", delivered 250 containers every month from Singapore to Diego Garcia.^[\[166\]](#cite_note-dgar-166)^ The ship delivered "more than 200,000 tons of cargo to the island each year".^[\[166\]](#cite_note-dgar-166)^ On the return trip to Singapore, it carried recyclable metals.^[\[167\]](#cite_note-167)^{#cite_ref-167}

In 2004, [TransAtlantic Lines](/wiki/TransAtlantic_Lines_LLC "TransAtlantic Lines LLC") outbid [Sealift Incorporated](/wiki/Sealift_Incorporated "Sealift Incorporated") for the transport contract between Singapore and Diego Garcia.^[\[168\]](#cite_note-sag-168)^ The route had previously been serviced by Sealift Inc.'s *MV Sagamore* , crewed by members of [American Maritime Officers](/wiki/American_Maritime_Officers "American Maritime Officers") and [Seafarers' International Union](/wiki/Seafarers%27_International_Union "Seafarers' International Union").^[\[168\]](#cite_note-sag-168)^ TransAtlantic Lines reportedly won the contract by approximately 10 per cent, representing a price difference of about $2.7 million.^[\[168\]](#cite_note-sag-168)^ The *Baffin Straits* charter ran from 10 January 2005, to 30 September 2008, at a daily rate of $12,550.{#cite_ref-sag_168-2}
