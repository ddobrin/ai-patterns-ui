**Singapore** ,^[\[f\]](#cite_note-14)^ officially the **Republic of Singapore** , is an [island country](/wiki/Island_country "Island country") and [city-state](/wiki/City-state "City-state") in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia"). The country's territory comprises one [main island](/wiki/Singapore_Island "Singapore Island"), [63 satellite islands and islets](/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Singapore "List of islands of Singapore"), and [one outlying islet](/wiki/Pedra_Branca,_Singapore "Pedra Branca, Singapore"). It is about one [degree of latitude](/wiki/Degree_of_latitude "Degree of latitude") (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the [equator](/wiki/Equator "Equator"), off the southern tip of the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula"), bordering the [Strait of Malacca](/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca "Strait of Malacca") to the west, the [Singapore Strait](/wiki/Singapore_Strait "Singapore Strait") to the south along with the [Riau Islands](/wiki/Riau_Islands "Riau Islands") in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia"), the [South China Sea](/wiki/South_China_Sea "South China Sea") to the east, and the [Straits of Johor](/wiki/Straits_of_Johor "Straits of Johor") along with the [State of Johor](/wiki/Johor "Johor") in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") to the north.{#cite_ref-14}

In its [early history](/wiki/Early_history_of_Singapore "Early history of Singapore"), Singapore was a maritime [emporium](/wiki/Emporium_(antiquity) "Emporium (antiquity)") known as *[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek")* and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive [thalassocratic](/wiki/Thalassocratic "Thalassocratic") empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles") established Singapore as an [entrepôt](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t "Entrepôt") trading post of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"). In 1867, Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements "Straits Settlements"). During [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Singapore was [occupied by Japan](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore "Japanese occupation of Singapore") in 1942 and returned to British control as a [Crown colony](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore "Colony of Singapore") following [Japan's surrender](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan "Surrender of Japan") in 1945. Singapore gained [self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore "Self-governance of Singapore") in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia"), alongside [Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya "Federation of Malaya"), [North Borneo](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_North_Borneo "Crown Colony of North Borneo"), and [Sarawak](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Sarawak "Crown Colony of Sarawak"). [Ideological differences](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia "Singapore in Malaysia") led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent [sovereign country](/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state") in 1965. After early years of [turbulence](/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_Singapore#1965_to_Late_1970s "History of the Republic of Singapore") and despite lacking natural resources and a [hinterland](/wiki/Hinterland "Hinterland"), the nation rapidly developed to become one of the [Four Asian Tigers](/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers "Four Asian Tigers").

As a highly [developed country](/wiki/Developed_country "Developed country"), it has one of the [highest PPP-adjusted GDP per capita](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita "List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita"). It is also identified as a [tax haven](/wiki/Tax_haven "Tax haven"). Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA [sovereign credit rating](/wiki/Credit_rating#Sovereign_credit_ratings "Credit rating") from [all major rating agencies](/wiki/Big_Three_(credit_rating_agencies) "Big Three (credit rating agencies)"). It is a major [aviation](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub"), [financial](/wiki/Financial_centre "Financial centre"), and [maritime shipping](/wiki/Port "Port") hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the [most expensive cities](/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_cities_for_expatriate_employees "List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees") to live in for [expatriates](/wiki/Expatriate "Expatriate") and [foreign workers](/wiki/Foreign_worker "Foreign worker"). Singapore ranks highly in key social indicators: [education](/wiki/Education_in_Singapore "Education in Singapore"), [healthcare](/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore "Healthcare in Singapore"), [quality of life](/wiki/Quality_of_life "Quality of life"), [personal safety](/wiki/Personal_safety "Personal safety"), [infrastructure](/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure"), and [housing](/wiki/Public_housing_in_Singapore "Public housing in Singapore"), with a [home-ownership rate](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate "List of countries by home ownership rate") of 88 percent. [Singaporeans](/wiki/Singaporeans "Singaporeans") enjoy one of the [longest life expectancies](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy "List of countries by life expectancy"), [fastest Internet connection speeds](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds "List of countries by Internet connection speeds"), [lowest infant mortality rates](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates "List of countries by infant and under-five mortality rates"), and [lowest levels of corruption](/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index "Corruption Perceptions Index") in the world. It has the [third highest population density of any country](/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density "List of countries and dependencies by population density"), although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of [urban planning](/wiki/Urban_planning "Urban planning"). With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four [official languages](/wiki/Languages_of_Singapore "Languages of Singapore"): [English](/wiki/Singaporean_English "Singaporean English"), [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language"), [Mandarin](/wiki/Singaporean_Mandarin "Singaporean Mandarin"), and [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language "Tamil language"). English is the [common language](/wiki/Lingua_franca "Lingua franca"), with exclusive use in numerous [public services](/wiki/Public_service "Public service"). [Multi-racialism](/wiki/Multiculturalism "Multiculturalism") is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape [national policies](/wiki/Race_in_Singapore "Race in Singapore").

Singapore is a [parliamentary republic](/wiki/Parliamentary_republic "Parliamentary republic") and its legal system is based on [common law](/wiki/Common_law "Common law"). While the country is *[de jure](/wiki/De_jure "De jure")* a [multi-party democracy](/wiki/Multi-party_democracy "Multi-party democracy") with [free elections](/wiki/General_elections_in_Singapore "General elections in Singapore"), the [government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore "Government of Singapore") under the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party "People's Action Party") (PAP) wields widespread control and [political dominance](/wiki/Dominant-party_system "Dominant-party system"). One of the five founding members of [ASEAN](/wiki/ASEAN "ASEAN"), Singapore is also the headquarters of the [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation](/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation") Secretariat, the [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council](/wiki/Pacific_Economic_Cooperation_Council "Pacific Economic Cooperation Council") Secretariat, and is the host city of many [international conferences and events](/wiki/MICE_(Meetings,_Incentives,_Conferences,_Exhibitions)_tourism "MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) tourism"). Singapore is also a member of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations"), the [World Trade Organization](/wiki/World_Trade_Organization "World Trade Organization"), the [East Asia Summit](/wiki/East_Asia_Summit "East Asia Summit"), the [Non-Aligned Movement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement"), and the [Commonwealth of Nations](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations").  

Name and etymology {#Name_and_etymology}
----------------------------------------

Main article: [Names of Singapore](/wiki/Names_of_Singapore "Names of Singapore")

The [English](/wiki/English_language "English language") name of "Singapore" is an [anglicisation](/wiki/Anglicisation "Anglicisation") of the native [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") name for the country, *Singapura* (
pronounced [\[siŋapura\]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Malay "Help:IPA/Malay")), which was in turn derived from the [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") word for 'lion city' ([Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_language "Sanskrit language"): सिंहपुर; [romanised:](/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration "International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration") *Siṃhapura*; [Brahmi](/wiki/Brahmi_script "Brahmi script"): 𑀲𑀺𑀁𑀳𑀧𑀼𑀭; literally "lion city"; *[siṃha](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B9#Sanskrit "wikt:सिंह")* means 'lion', *[pura](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0#Sanskrit "wikt:पुर")* means 'city' or 'fortress').^[\[9\]](#cite_note-15)^ [Pulau Ujong](/wiki/Singapore_Island "Singapore Island") was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island, which corresponds to a Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as *[Pú Luó Zhōng](/wiki/Pulau_Ujong "Pulau Ujong")* ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): [蒲](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%92%B2 "wikt:蒲") [羅](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%85 "wikt:羅") [中](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD "wikt:中")), a transcription of the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") name for 'island at the end of [a peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula")'.^[\[10\]](#cite_note-utexas-16)^ Early references to the name [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") (or Tumasik) are found in the [Nagarakretagama](/wiki/Nagarakretagama "Nagarakretagama"), a [Javanese](/wiki/Java_(island) "Java (island)") [eulogy](/wiki/Eulogy "Eulogy") written in 1365, and a [Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam") source from the same time period. The name possibly means *Sea Town* , being derived from the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") *tasek*, meaning 'sea' or 'lake'.^[\[11\]](#cite_note-toponym-17)^ The [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_people "Chinese people") traveller [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan "Wang Dayuan") visited a place around 1330 named *Danmaxi* ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): 淡馬錫; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): *Dànmǎxí* ; [Wade--Giles](/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Giles "Wade–Giles"): *Tan Ma Hsi* ) or *Tam ma siak* , depending on pronunciation; this may be a transcription of [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek"), alternatively, it may be a combination of the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") *Tanah* meaning 'land' and [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") *xi* meaning 'tin', which was traded on the island.^[\[12\]](#cite_note-18)^^[\[11\]](#cite_note-toponym-17)^{#cite_ref-toponym_17-1}

Variations of the name *Siṃhapura* were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of Singapura"). In [Hindu--Buddhist culture](/wiki/Buddhism_and_Hinduism "Buddhism and Hinduism"), lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name.^[\[13\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiksic2013[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidbMt3BgAAQBAJpgPA151_151–152]-19)^^[\[14\]](#cite_note-20)^ The name *Singapura* supplanted [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of Singapura") on the island by a fleeing Sumatran *[Raja](/wiki/Raja "Raja")* (prince) from [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang "Palembang"). However, the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown. The semi-historical [Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals") state that [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek") was christened *Singapura* by [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama"), a 13th-century Sumatran *[Raja](/wiki/Raja "Raja")* from [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang "Palembang"). [The Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals") state that [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama") encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he established the town of *Singapura* where he encountered the beast.^[\[15\]](#cite_note-21)^^: 37, 88--92^^[\[16\]](#cite_note-22)^^: 30--31^ The second hypothesis, drawn from [Portuguese sources](/wiki/Tom%C3%A9_Pires#The_Suma_Oriental "Tomé Pires"), postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_(king) "Parameswara (king)") of [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang "Palembang"). [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_(king) "Parameswara (king)") declared independence from [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") and mounted a Lion Throne. After then being driven into exile by the [Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_people "Javanese people"), he usurped control over [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek"). He may have rechristened the area as *Singapura* , recalling the throne he had been driven from.^[\[17\]](#cite_note-turnbull-23)^{#cite_ref-turnbull_23-0}

Under [Japanese occupation](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore "Japanese occupation of Singapore"), Singapore was renamed *Syonan-to* ([Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"): [昭](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%AD "wikt:昭") [南](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8D%97 "wikt:南"), [Hepburn](/wiki/Hepburn_romanization "Hepburn romanization"): *Shōnan*), meaning 'light of the south'.^[\[18\]](#cite_note-24)^^[\[19\]](#cite_note-25)^ Singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the "Garden City", in reference to its parks and tree-lined streets.^[\[20\]](#cite_note-26)^ Another informal name, the "[Little Red Dot](/wiki/Little_red_dot "Little red dot")", was adopted after an article in the *[Asian Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal_Asia "The Wall Street Journal Asia")* of 4 August 1998 said that [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") President [B. J. Habibie](/wiki/B._J._Habibie "B. J.

In 1299, according to the *[Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals "Malay Annals")* , the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura "Kingdom of Singapura") was founded on the island by [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama "Sang Nila Utama").^[\[25\]](#cite_note-31)^ Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the *Malay Annals* is the subject of academic debates,^[\[26\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiksic2013[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidbMt3BgAAQBAJpgPA154_154]-32)^ it is nevertheless known from various documents that Singapore in the 14th century, then known as [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek "Temasek"), was a trading port under the influence of both the [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") Empire and the [Siamese](/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom "Ayutthaya Kingdom") kingdoms,^[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiksic2013[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidbMt3BgAAQBAJpgPA184_183–185]-33)^ and was a part of the [Indosphere](/wiki/Indosphere "Indosphere").^[\[28\]](#cite_note-Dixon-34)^^[\[29\]](#cite_note-Matisoff1990-35)^^[\[30\]](#cite_note-Enfield-36)^^[\[31\]](#cite_note-academia_edu-37)^^[\[32\]](#cite_note-38)^ These Indianised kingdoms were characterised by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability.^[\[33\]](#cite_note-39)^ Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century, its ruler [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_(king) "Parameswara (king)") was attacked by either the [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit "Majapahit") or the Siamese, forcing him to move to [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca "Malacca") where he founded the [Sultanate of Malacca](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca "Sultanate of Malacca").^[\[34\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiksic2013[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidbMt3BgAAQBAJpgPA162_155–163]-40)^ Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on [Fort Canning Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill "Fort Canning Hill") was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards.^[\[17\]](#cite_note-turnbull-23)^ In 1613, [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people") raiders burned down the settlement, and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries.^[\[35\]](#cite_note-Borschbergp157-158-41)^ By then, Singapore was nominally part of the [Johor Sultanate](/wiki/Johor_Sultanate "Johor Sultanate").^[\[36\]](#cite_note-country_studies-42)^ The wider maritime region and much trade was under Dutch control for the following period after the 1641 [Dutch conquest of Malacca](/wiki/Dutch_Malacca "Dutch Malacca").^[\[37\]](#cite_note-uslcFοunding-43)^{#cite_ref-uslcFοunding_43-0}

The British governor [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles "Stamford Raffles") arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port.^[\[40\]](#cite_note-YongRao1995-46)^ The island was then nominally ruled by [Tengku Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Muazzam_Shah_of_Johor "Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah of Johor"), the [Sultan of Johor](/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor "Sultan of Johor"), who was controlled by the [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_Empire "Dutch Empire") and the [Bugis](/wiki/Bugis "Bugis").^[\[41\]](#cite_note-Trocki2009-47)^ However, the [Sultanate](/wiki/Sultanate "Sultanate") was weakened by factional division: [Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman "Temenggong Abdul Rahman"), the [Temenggong of Johor](/wiki/Temenggong_of_Johor "Temenggong of Johor") to Tengku Abdul Rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to the Sultan's elder brother [Tengku Long](/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor "Hussein Shah of Johor"), who was living in [exile](/wiki/Exile "Exile") in [Penyengat Island](/wiki/Penyengat_Island "Penyengat Island"), [Riau Islands](/wiki/Riau_Islands "Riau Islands"). With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. Raffles offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, under the title of [Sultan Hussein](/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor "Hussein Shah of Johor"), as well as provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and another $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.^[\[42\]](#cite_note-uslcFounding-48)^ The [Treaty of Singapore](/wiki/1819_Singapore_Treaty "1819 Singapore Treaty") was signed on 6 February 1819.^[\[43\]](#cite_note-49)^^[\[44\]](#cite_note-50)^{#cite_ref-50}

After the [Japanese surrender](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan "Surrender of Japan") to the [Allies](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread.

Much of the infrastructure in Singapore had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber.^[\[71\]](#cite_note-uslcAftermathOfWar-78)^ The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans. [British Military Administration](/wiki/British_Military_Administration_(Malaya) "British Military Administration (Malaya)") ended on 1 April 1946, and Singapore became a separate [Crown Colony](/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown colony").^[\[71\]](#cite_note-uslcAftermathOfWar-78)^ In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled for the following year.^[\[72\]](#cite_note-micaSelfGovernment-79)^{#cite_ref-micaSelfGovernment_79-0}

In the 1960s, [bumboats](/wiki/Bumboat "Bumboat") were used to transport cargoes and supplies between nearshore ships and Singapore River.

PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable left-wing faction of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis "Barisan Sosialis"), after being kicked out from the PAP.^[\[78\]](#cite_note-85)^^[\[79\]](#cite_note-86)^ The ruling party of Malaya, [United Malays National Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation "United Malays National Organisation") (UMNO), was staunchly anti-communist, and it was suspected UMNO would support the non-communist factions of PAP. UMNO, initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP government and concern that the large ethnic Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance in Malaya on which their political power base depended, became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover.^[\[80\]](#cite_note-Wipe_out_extremists-87)^{#cite_ref-Wipe_out_extremists_87-0}

The increase is expected to come primarily from non-domestic water use, which accounted for 55% of water demand in 2010 and is expected to account for 70% of demand in 2060. By that time, water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of 50% and by desalination accounting for 30%, compared to only 20% supplied by internal catchments.^[\[328\]](#cite_note-335)^^[\[329\]](#cite_note-336)^{#cite_ref-336}

[Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism_in_Singapore "Buddhism in Singapore") is the most widely practised religion, with 31% of residents declaring themselves adherents in the 2020 census. [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity_in_Singapore "Christianity in Singapore") was the second largest religion at 18.9%, followed by [Islam](/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore "Islam in Singapore") (15.6%), [Taoism](/wiki/Taoism_in_Singapore "Taoism in Singapore") and [Chinese Traditional Beliefs](/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion "Chinese folk religion") (8.8%) and [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism_in_Singapore "Hinduism in Singapore") (5.0%). One-fifth of the population had no religious affiliation. The proportion of Christians, Muslims, and the nonreligious slightly increased between 2010 and 2020, while the proportion of Buddhists and Taoists slightly decreased; Hinduism and other faiths remained largely stable in their share of the population.^[\[416\]](#cite_note-2010censuspercentage-423)^{#cite_ref-2010censuspercentage_423-0}

Singapore hosts monasteries and [Dharma](/wiki/Dharma "Dharma") centres from all three major traditions of Buddhism: [Theravada](/wiki/Theravada "Theravada"), [Mahayana](/wiki/Mahayana "Mahayana"), and [Vajrayana](/wiki/Vajrayana "Vajrayana"). Most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese and adhere to the Mahayana tradition,^[\[417\]](#cite_note-424)^ owing to decades of missionary activity from China. However, [Thailand's Theravada Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism_in_Thailand "Buddhism in Thailand") has seen growing popularity among the populace (not only the Chinese) during the past decade. [Soka Gakkai International](/wiki/Soka_Gakkai_International "Soka Gakkai International"), a Japanese Buddhist organisation, is practised by many people in Singapore, and mostly by those of Chinese descent. [Tibetan Buddhism](/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism "Tibetan Buddhism") has also made slow inroads into the country in recent years.^[\[418\]](#cite_note-425)^{#cite_ref-425}

Education takes place in three stages: primary, secondary, and pre-university education, with the primary education being compulsory. Students begin with six years of primary school, which is made up of a four-year foundation course and a two-year orientation stage. The curriculum is focused on the development of English, the mother tongue, [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), and [science](/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science").^[\[451\]](#cite_note-Primary-458)^^[\[452\]](#cite_note-459)^ Secondary school lasts from four to five years, and is divided between Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams in each school, depending on a student's ability level.^[\[453\]](#cite_note-Secondary-460)^ The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised.^[\[454\]](#cite_note-461)^ Pre-university education takes place at either the 21 [Junior Colleges](/wiki/Junior_college_(Singapore) "Junior college (Singapore)") or the [Millennia Institute](/wiki/Millennia_Institute "Millennia Institute"), over a period of two and three years respectively.^[\[455\]](#cite_note-Pre-university-462)^ As alternatives to pre-university education, however, courses are offered in other post-secondary education institutions, including the 5 polytechnics and 3 ITE colleges.
