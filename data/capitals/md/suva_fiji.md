**Suva** (
Fijian pronunciation: [\[ˈsuβa\]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Fijian "Help:IPA/Fijian"); [Fiji Hindi](/wiki/Fiji_Hindi_language "Fiji Hindi language"): सुवा) is the [capital](/wiki/Capital_city "Capital city") and the most populous city of [Fiji](/wiki/Fiji "Fiji"). It is the home of the country's largest metropolitan area and serves as its major port. The city is located on the southeast coast of the island of [Viti Levu](/wiki/Viti_Levu "Viti Levu"), in [Rewa Province](/wiki/Rewa_Province "Rewa Province"), [Central Division](/wiki/Central_Division,_Fiji "Central Division, Fiji").

In 1877, the capital of Fiji was moved to Suva from [Levuka](/wiki/Levuka "Levuka"), the main European colonial settlement at the time, due to the restrictive geography and environs of the latter. The administration of the colony was transferred from Levuka to Suva in 1882.

As of the 2017 census, the city of Suva had a [population](/wiki/Demographics_of_Fiji "Demographics of Fiji") of 93,970,^[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)^ and Suva's metropolitan area, which includes its independent suburbs, had a population of 185,913.^[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)^ The combined urban population of Suva and the towns of [Lami](/wiki/Lami,_Fiji "Lami, Fiji"), [Nasinu](/wiki/Nasinu "Nasinu"), and [Nausori](/wiki/Nausori "Nausori") that border it was around 330,000: over a third of the nation's population (This urban complex, excluding Lami, is also known as the [Suva-Nausori corridor](/wiki/Suva-Nausori_corridor "Suva-Nausori corridor")).{#cite_ref-2}

Suva is the political, economic, and cultural centre of Fiji. It is also the economic and cultural capital of the South Pacific, hosting the majority of the regional headquarters of major international corporations, international agencies, and diplomatic missions. The city also has a thriving arts and performance scene, and a growing reputation as the region's [fashion capital](/wiki/Fashion_capital "Fashion capital").

In 1868, when Suva was still a small village, the [Bauan](/wiki/Bau_Island "Bau Island") [chieftain](/wiki/Ratu "Ratu"), [Seru Epenisa Cakobau](/wiki/Seru_Epenisa_Cakobau "Seru Epenisa Cakobau"), granted 5,000 km^2^ (1,900 sq mi) of land to the Australian-based Polynesia Company, in exchange for the company's promise to pay off debts owed to the United States. More than a tenth of this land area, 575 km^2^ (222 sq mi), was located near Suva. The company's original intention was to develop a cotton farming industry, but the land and climate proved unsuitable. ^[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)^{#cite_ref-3}

In 1874, control of the Fiji Islands was ceded to the United Kingdom. In 1877, the [colonial authorities](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") decided to move the capital to Suva from [Levuka](/wiki/Levuka "Levuka"), Ovalau, Lomaiviti, because Levuka's location between a steep mountain and the sea made any expansion of the town impractical. Colonel [F. E. Pratt](/w/index.php?title=F._E._Pratt&action=edit&redlink=1 "F. E. Pratt (page does not exist)") of the [Royal Engineers](/wiki/Royal_Engineers "Royal Engineers") was appointed Surveyor-General in 1875 and designed the new capital in Suva, assisted by W. Stephens and Colonel R. W. Stewart. The transfer of the administration to Suva was made official in 1882.^[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)^{#cite_ref-4}

In 1910, Suva acquired the status of a municipality, under the Municipal Constitution Ordinance of 1909. Its area remained one square mile until 1952 when Suva annexed the [Muanikau](/w/index.php?title=Muanikau&action=edit&redlink=1 "Muanikau (page does not exist)") and [Samabula](/w/index.php?title=Samabula&action=edit&redlink=1 "Samabula (page does not exist)") [wards](/wiki/Ward_(politics) "Ward (politics)"), expanding its territory to 13 km^2^ (5.0 sq mi). In October of that year, Suva was officially designated a city -- Fiji's first. Suva later annexed [Tamavua](/wiki/Tamavua "Tamavua"). Most recently, Suva further extended its boundaries by incorporating the [Cunningham](/w/index.php?title=Cunningham_(Fiji)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cunningham (Fiji) (page does not exist)") area at its northern edge. Since then, [urban sprawl](/wiki/Urban_sprawl "Urban sprawl") has led to the growth of a number of suburbs that remain outside the city limits. Together with the city, they form the metropolitan area known as the [Greater Suva Area](/w/index.php?title=Greater_Suva_Area&action=edit&redlink=1 "Greater Suva Area (page does not exist)").^[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)^{#cite_ref-5}

Suva hosted the [South Pacific Games in 2003](/wiki/2003_South_Pacific_Games "2003 South Pacific Games") for the third time in the event's 40-year history. In preparation for hosting the event, the Fijian [government](/wiki/Politics_of_Fiji "Politics of Fiji"), with the help of a $16 million aid package from the People's Republic of China, funded the construction of a new gymnasium, indoor sports centre, swimming pool, stadium, [field hockey](/wiki/Field_hockey "Field hockey") pitch, and grandstands in the area around Suva.^[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)^{#cite_ref-6}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suva&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Geography and physical characteristics")\]

In addition to being the capital of Fiji, Suva is also its commercial and political centre (though not necessarily its cultural centre), and its main port city. It has a mix of modern buildings and colonial-period architecture.

Suva is located around a harbour on a hilly peninsula in the southeast corner of [Viti Levu](/wiki/Viti_Levu "Viti Levu") Island, between Laucala Bay and Suva Harbour. The mountains to its north and west catch the southeast trade winds, producing year-round moist conditions.

Although Suva is on a peninsula, and almost surrounded by sea, its coast is lined with mangroves - the nearest beach is 40 kilometres (25 mi) away, at [Pacific Harbour](/wiki/Pacific_Harbour "Pacific Harbour"). A significant part of the city centre, including the [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Fiji "Parliament of Fiji") buildings, is built on reclaimed mangrove swampland.  

### City wards {#City_wards}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suva&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: City wards")\]

Below is a list of the city's five wards,^[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)^^\[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]^^[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)^ beginning with the city centre, followed by the northwesternmost ward, and then in clockwise order:{#cite_ref-8}

1. Central: city centre; mostly commercial, [central business district](/wiki/Central_business_district "Central business district")
2. Tamavua: urban; mostly residential
3. Extension: semi-urban; residential
4. Samabula: urban; residential, industrial, and commercial; has its own separate town centre; includes a university
5. Muanikau: urban; mostly industrial and residential; includes large sporting venues, a university, and recreational areas

### Suva--Nausori Corridor {#Suva.E2.80.93Nausori_Corridor}

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suva&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Suva–Nausori Corridor")\]

Suva sits in the middle of a metropolitan area, sometimes known as the [Suva Urban Complex](/wiki/Suva-Nausori_corridor "Suva-Nausori corridor"), and sometimes informally known as Suva, even though it encompasses a total of four areas with their own town or city names and their own separate local governments. This conurbation stretches from [Lami](/wiki/Lami,_Fiji "Lami, Fiji") (immediately west of the city of Suva) along the Queens Highway, through [Nasinu](/wiki/Nasinu "Nasinu") (immediately east of the city of Suva), to the [Rewa River](/wiki/Rewa_River "Rewa River"), along the Kings Highway, and then to [Nausori](/wiki/Nausori "Nausori") across the river. To the north and northeast are the rainforest-park areas of Colo-i-Suva and Sawani, along the Princes Road, which connect at the [Rewa River Bridge](/wiki/Rewa_Bridge "Rewa Bridge"). This whole area (excluding Lami) is also formally referred to as the Suva--Nausori Corridor. It is the most populous area in Fiji, with over 330,000 inhabitants.

Suva has a [tropical rainforest climate](/wiki/Tropical_rainforest_climate "Tropical rainforest climate"), according to the [Köppen climate classification](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") system. But because of its trade winds and occasional [cyclones](/wiki/Cyclone "Cyclone"), it is not an equatorial climate. The city sees a copious amount of precipitation throughout the year, with no true dry season; no month has an average rainfall below 60 mm (2 in). Suva averages 3,000 mm (118 inches) of precipitation annually. Its driest month, July, averages 125 mm (4.92 in). As in many other cities with a tropical rainforest climate, temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with an average high of about 28 °C (82 °F) and an average low of about 22 °C (72 °F).

Suva has a markedly higher rainfall than [Nadi](/wiki/Nadi "Nadi") or the western side of [Viti Levu](/wiki/Viti_Levu "Viti Levu") (known to Suva inhabitants as "the burning west"). The second governor of Fiji, [Sir Arthur Gordon](/wiki/Arthur_Hamilton-Gordon,_1st_Baron_Stanmore "Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore"), is said to have remarked that he had never seen it rain anywhere the way it rains in Suva and that there was hardly a day without rain. The most copious rainfall is observed from November to May, while the slightly cooler months from June to October see considerably more moderate rainfall.

Suva is a multiracial and multicultural city. [Indigenous Fijians](/wiki/Fijians "Fijians") and [Indo-Fijians](/wiki/Indians_in_Fiji "Indians in Fiji"), the two principal ethnic groups of Fiji, comprise the bulk of Suva's population, and the city is home to most of Fiji's ethnic minority populations, which include Rotumans, Lauans, Rambians, [Europeans](/wiki/Europeans_in_Oceania "Europeans in Oceania") (known as *Kaivalagi* ), part-Europeans (of European and Fijian descent, known as "Kailoma") and [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_in_Fiji "Chinese in Fiji"), among others. The most widely spoken language is English, but [Fijian](/wiki/Fijian_language "Fijian language"), [Fiji Hindi](/wiki/Fiji_Hindi "Fiji Hindi"), and other languages are also spoken by their respective communities.

Suva's inhabitants are representative of all the major indigenous Pacific groups: it is sometimes referred to as the "[New York](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") of the Pacific". The city has a reputation as a major economic centre in the region and is the site of [University of the South Pacific](/wiki/University_of_the_South_Pacific "University of the South Pacific")'s main campus. This has led to an influx of Pacific migrants, who study, work, and live in the city and its boroughs.

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suva&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Municipal government")\]  
Main article: [Suva City Council](/wiki/Suva_City_Council "Suva City Council")

Suva has [municipal](/wiki/Local_government_in_Fiji "Local government in Fiji") status and, until 2009, was governed by a [lord mayor](/wiki/Mayor "Mayor") and a 20-member [city council](/wiki/City_council "City council"). The Suva City Council was the municipal law-making body of the city of Suva, Fiji's capital. It consisted of 20 councillors, elected for three-year terms from four multi-member constituencies, called wards. Councillors were elected by residents, landowners, and representatives of corporations owning or occupying taxable property in Suva councillors in turn elect, from among their own members, a lord mayor and deputy lord mayor, who served one-year terms and were eligible for re-election.

However, in 2009, the [military](/wiki/Republic_of_Fiji_Military_Forces "Republic of Fiji Military Forces")-backed interim Fijian government dismissed all municipal government officials throughout Fiji and appointed special administrators to run the urban areas. As of 2015^[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suva&action=edit)^, elected municipal government had not been restored. The special administrator of Suva, along with nearby [Nasinu](/wiki/Nasinu "Nasinu"), is [Chandu Umaria](/w/index.php?title=Chandu_Umaria&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chandu Umaria (page does not exist)"), a former lord mayor of Suva.^[\[12\]](#cite_note-RNZI_44529-12)^{#cite_ref-RNZI_44529_12-0}

A well-known landmark is the [Suva City Carnegie Library](/w/index.php?title=Suva_City_Carnegie_Library&action=edit&redlink=1 "Suva City Carnegie Library (page does not exist)"), which was built in 1909. It is one of many colonial-period buildings in the city.

Another landmark is Suva's governmental building complex. It sits on what was once the flowing waters of a creek. In 1935, the creek was drained, and the complex's foundations were created by driving more than five kilometres of reinforced concrete pilings into its bed. The foundation stone was laid in 1937, the building complex was completed in 1939, and a new wing was completed in 1967. However, in 1992, the seat of Fiji's [parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Fiji "Parliament of Fiji") was moved out of that complex and into a new one on [Ratu Sukuna Road](/w/index.php?title=Ratu_Sukuna_Road&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ratu Sukuna Road (page does not exist)").

[Government House](/wiki/Government_House,_Suva "Government House, Suva") was formerly the residence of Fiji's [colonial](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") [governors](/wiki/Governor_of_Fiji "Governor of Fiji") and, after Fijian independence in 1970, [governors-general](/wiki/Governor-General_of_Fiji "Governor-General of Fiji"). Today, it is the official residence of Fiji's [president](/wiki/President_of_Fiji "President of Fiji"). The original house on the site was built in 1882, but a fire caused by a lightning strike destroyed it in 1921, it was rebuilt in 1928.

The Suva campus of the [University of the South Pacific](/wiki/University_of_the_South_Pacific "University of the South Pacific") (USP) occupies what was originally a New Zealand military base. It is the largest of the many USP campuses dotted throughout the South Pacific. USP is the largest university in the [Pacific Islands](/wiki/Pacific_Islands "Pacific Islands") outside Hawaii, and its courses are internationally recognised and endorsed.

The [Fiji Museum](/wiki/Fiji_Museum "Fiji Museum"), now located in [Thurston Gardens](/wiki/Thurston_Gardens "Thurston Gardens"), was founded in 1904, and originally occupied the old town hall. It was moved to its present location in 1954. The museum houses the most extensive collection of Fijian artifacts in the world, and is also a research and educational institution, specialising in archaeology, the preservation of Fiji's oral tradition, and the publication of material on Fiji's language and culture.

Suva has about 78 parks. The new [Takashi Suzuki Garden](/w/index.php?title=Takashi_Suzuki_Garden&action=edit&redlink=1 "Takashi Suzuki Garden (page does not exist)"), in [Apted Park](/w/index.php?title=Apted_Park&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apted Park (page does not exist)") at [Suva Point](/w/index.php?title=Suva_Point&action=edit&redlink=1 "Suva Point (page does not exist)"), is a popular spot for viewing sunrise and sunset. [Thurston Gardens](/wiki/Thurston_Gardens "Thurston Gardens"), which opened in 1913, features flora from throughout the South Pacific.

Suva has many shopping and retail areas, notably Cumming Street, which has been a vibrant and colourful shopping area since colonial times. The Cumming Street area features original colonial buildings and narrow roads. Suva also has modern shopping malls, such as the Suva Central Shopping Mall, the Mid-City Mall, and MHCC, along with other developments give much of the city a modern and sophisticated look.

TappooCity^[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)^ is one of Fiji's shopping mall,^[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)^ and the largest in the South Pacific outside of Australia and New Zealand. This low-rise (six-storey) building was constructed in December 2009 in a joint venture by FNPF and the Tappoo Group of Companies. It is valued at US$25.7 million (FJD50 million). ^\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]^{#cite_ref-14}

Construction work began in January 2011 for a FJD30 -million mini-mall complex at Grantham Road, behind the Sports-City Complex and close to the Suva campus of the [University of the South Pacific](/wiki/University_of_the_South_Pacific "University of the South Pacific"). It was scheduled to be completed in 2012, and to house restaurants, retail outlets, and cinemas.^[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)^{#cite_ref-15}

Unlike most cities and towns in Fiji, and many around the world, Suva did not grow up around a single industry. It has gradually developed to become the largest and most sophisticated city in the Pacific Islands, and a regional hub. Fijians of Indian descent have largely shaped the economy of Fiji, contributing immensely to the growth of Suva and to its status as the economic and political capital of Fiji. Suva is the commercial center of Fiji: Most international banks have their Pacific headquarters here, including [ANZ](/wiki/ANZ_Bank "ANZ Bank") and the [Westpac](/wiki/Westpac "Westpac"). In addition, most Fijian financial institutions, [non-governmental organisations](/wiki/Non-governmental_organisations "Non-governmental organisations"), and government ministries and departments are headquartered here. At one point, both Air Pacific^[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)^ (now [Fiji Airways](/wiki/Fiji_Airways "Fiji Airways")) and [Air Fiji](/wiki/Air_Fiji "Air Fiji")^[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)^ were headquartered in Suva.{#cite_ref-17}

A large part of Fiji's [international shipping](/wiki/Shipping "Shipping"), as well as the docking of international cruise ships, takes place at Suva's Kings Wharf. This has led to the growth of Suva's [tourism industry](/wiki/Tourism "Tourism").

The largest of Suva's several industrial areas is Walu Bay, which is home to factories, [warehouses](/wiki/Warehouses "Warehouses"), import-export companies, [shipyards](/wiki/Shipyards "Shipyards"), container yards, a brewery, and many printeries. Other notable industrial areas are Vatuwaqa, Raiwaqa, and Laucala Beach.

Suva boasts many thriving markets and shopping complexes. Among the most popular areas for shopping and commerce are Cumming Street and Victoria Parade.
