Zagreb stands near the international border between Croatia and Slovenia at an elevation of approximately 158 m (518 ft) above sea level.[11] At the 2021 census, the city itself had a population of 767,131,[3] while the population of Zagreb metropolitan area is 1,086,528. The oldest settlement in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's Šćitarjevo.[12] The historical record of the name "Zagreb" dates from 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal city in 1242.[13] In 1851, Janko Kamauf became Zagreb's first mayor.[14] Zagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division—it comprises a consolidated city-county (but separate from Zagreb County),[15] and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts.[16] Most of the city districts lie at a low elevation along the valley of the river Sava, but northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme[17] and Sesvete[18] districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain,[19] making the city's geographical image quite diverse. The city extends over 30 km (19 mi) east-west and around 20 km (12 mi) north-south.[20][21] Zagreb ranks as a global city, with a 'Beta-' rating from the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.[22] The transport connections, the concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia.[23][24][25] Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries.[26][27][28] Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia: here Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Major branches of Zagreb's economy include high-tech industries and the service sector. Name [edit] The etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.[29] The name is first recorded in a charter by Felician, Archbishop of Esztergom, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum.[30] The name is probably derived from Proto-Slavic word *grębъ which means "hill" or "uplift". An Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagrębъ is manifested through the city's former German name, Agram.[31] Some linguists (e.g. Nada Klaić, Miroslav Kravar) propose a metathesis of *Zabreg, which would originate from Old Slavic breg (see Proto-Slavic *bergъ) in the sense of "riverbank", referring to River Sava. This metathesis has been attested in Kajkavian,[32] but the meaning of "riverbank" is lost in modern Croatian and folk etymology associates it instead with breg "hill", ostensibly referring to Medvednica. Hungarian linguist Gyula Décsy similarly uses metathesis to construct *Chaprakov(o), a putative Slavicisation of a Hungarian hypocorism for "Cyprian", similar to the etymology of Csepreg, Hungary.[33] The most likely derivation is *Zagrębъ in the sense of "embankment" or "rampart", i.e. remains of the 1st millennium fortifications on Grič.[32][31] In Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo),[citation needed] Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Grič (Gradec)). The most common folk etymology of the name of the city has been from the verb stem za-grab-, meaning "to scoop" or "to dig". A folk legend illustrating this derivation, attested but discarded as a serious etymology by Ivan Tkalčić, ties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Kažotić (c. 1260–1323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.[34] In another legend,[35][36][37][38][39] a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to "scoop" water from the Manduševac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jelačić Square), using the imperative: Zagrabi, Mando! ("Scoop, Manda!").[40] History [edit] Main article: History of Zagreb For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Zagreb. Ruins of the ancient Roman town Andautonia near Zagreb The oldest known settlement located near present-day Zagreb, the Roman town of Andautonia, now Ščitarjevo, existed between the 1st and the 5th centuries AD.[41] The first recorded appearance of the name "Zagreb" dates from 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centers: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. In 1851 the Ban of Croatia, Josip Jelačić, united Gradec and Kaptol; the name of the main city square, Ban Jelačić Square honors him.[42] While Croatia formed part of Yugoslavia (1918 to 1991), Zagreb remained an important economic centre of that country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia (Croatian: Sabor Republike Hrvatske) proclaimed Zagreb as the capital of the Republic of Croatia.[43] Early Zagreb [edit] The history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against the Kingdom of Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill, with the border between the two formed by the Medveščak stream.[44] Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best-preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Mongol attack in 1242.[45] As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Mongols, the Croatian and Hungarian King Béla IV granted Gradec the Golden Bull of 1242, which gave its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as their own judicial system.[46][47] The relationship between Kaptol and Gradec throughout history [edit] The development of Kaptol began in 1094 after the foundation of the diocese, while the growth of Gradec began after the Golden Bull was issued in 1242. In the history of the city of Zagreb, there have been numerous conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, mainly due to disputed issues of rent collection and due to disputed properties. The first known conflicts took place in the middle of the 13th century and continued with interruptions until 1667. Because of the conflict, it was recorded that the Bishop of Kaptol excommunicated the residents of Gradec twice. In the conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, there were several massacres of the citizens, destruction of houses and looting of citizens. In 1850, Gradec and Kaptol, with surrounding settlements, were united into a single settlement, today's city of Zagreb.[48][49][50][51][52] 16th to 18th centuries [edit] Modern Zagreb's town core emerged from the Upper Town medieval settlements of Gradec and Kaptol. Picture from 1689. There were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they were not known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political center, and the regional Sabor (Latin: Congregatio Regnorum Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae) representing Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb became the Croatian capital in 1557, with city also being chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola IX Frankopan.[53] At the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school,[54] the St. Catherine's Church (built 1620-1632[55]) and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology, and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and by the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Varaždin to Zagreb and during the reign of the Emperor Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Varaždin and Karlovac general command.[56] 19th to mid-20th century [edit] Copperplate of the panorama of Zagreb from 1822 Mass protests in Zagreb against the unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with the Kingdom of Serbia in 1918. Croatian Partisans enter Ban Jelačić Square on May 9, 1945, national celebration on the square In the 19th century, Zagreb was the center of the Croatian National Revival and saw the foundation of important cultural and historic institutions. In 1850, the town was united under its first mayor – Janko Kamauf.[56] The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. Since 1 January 1877, the Grič cannon fires daily from the Lotrščak Tower on Grič to mark midday. The Zagreb waterworks opened in 1878. After the 1880 Zagreb earthquake,[57] up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today. The first horse-drawn tram dated from 1891. The construction of railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterized by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core includes many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres, and cinemas. An electric-power plant was built in 1907. The first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighborhoods like Stara Peščenica in the east and Črnomerec in the west grew up. The Rokov perivoj neighbourhood, noted for its Art Nouveau features, was established at the start of the century.[58] After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars. In the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent – the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair opened.[56] During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945), which was backed by Nazi Germany and by the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of régime terror and resistance sabotage - the Ustaša régime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. Partisans took the city at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb functioned as the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Contemporary era [edit] The area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction-boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called "Južni Zagreb" (Southern Zagreb).[59] From 1999 Novi Zagreb has comprised two city districts: Novi Zagreb – zapad (New Zagreb – West) and Novi Zagreb – istok (New Zagreb – East) The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato, and other settlements. The cargo railway hub and the international airport (Pleso) were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (Žitnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city, represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.[56] This event initiated the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre and extensive new sport infrastructure, lacking until then, all around the city.[citation needed] During the 1991–1995 Croatian War of Independence, the city saw some sporadic fighting around its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many. An urbanized area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zaprešić, Samobor, Dugo Selo, and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.[60] Geography [edit] Climate [edit] The climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), bordering a humid continental climate (Dfb). Satellite view of Zagreb Aerial view of Zagreb's downtown Zagreb has four distinct seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it often becomes very warm or even hot with occasional afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 °C (86 °F) on average 14.6 days each summer. During summertime, rainfall is abundant and it mainly falls during thunderstorms. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's ninth wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris or London. Compared to these cities, however, Zagreb has fewer rainy days, but the annual rainfall is higher due to heavier showers occurring mainly in late spring and summer. Autumn in its early stage often brings pleasant and sunny weather with occasional episodes of rain later in the season. Late autumn is characterized by a mild increase in the number of rainy days and a gradual decrease in daily temperature averages. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as south-central districts along the Sava river being more prone to longer fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold, bringing overcast skies and a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with the first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of days with snowfall in wintertime has decreased considerably. Spring is characterized by often pleasant but changeable weather. As the season progresses, sunny days become more frequent, bringing higher temperatures. Sometimes cold spells can occur as well, mostly in the season's early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 °C (34 °F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is 20 °C (68.0 °F).[61] The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) in July 1950, and lowest was −27.3 °C (−17.1 °F) in February 1956.[62] A temperature of −30.5 °C (−22.9 °F) was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.[63] Climate data for Zagreb Maksimir (1971–2000, extremes 1949–2019) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 19.4 (66.9) 22.6 (72.7) 26.0 (78.8) 30.5 (86.9) 33.7 (92.7) 37.6 (99.7) 40.4 (104.7) 39.8 (103.6) 34.0 (93.2) 28.3 (82.9) 25.4 (77.7) 22.5 (72.5) 40.4 (104.7) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 3.7 (38.7) 6.8 (44.2) 11.9 (53.4) 16.3 (61.3) 21.5 (70.7) 24.5 (76.1) 26.7 (80.1) 26.3 (79.3) 22.1 (71.8) 15.8 (60.4) 8.9 (48.0) 4.6 (40.3) 15.8 (60.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 0.3 (32.5) 2.3 (36.1) 6.4 (43.5) 10.7 (51.3) 15.8 (60.4) 18.8 (65.8) 20.6 (69.1) 20.1 (68.2) 15.9 (60.6) 10.5 (50.9) 5.0 (41.0) 1.4 (34.5) 10.7 (51.3) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) −3.0 (26.6) −1.8 (28.8) 1.6 (34.9) 5.2 (41.4) 9.8 (49.6) 13.0 (55.4) 14.7 (58.5) 14.4 (57.9) 10.8 (51.4) 6.2 (43.2) 1.4 (34.5) −1.7 (28.9) 5.9 (42.6) Record low °C (°F) −24.3 (−11.7) −27.3 (−17.1) −18.3 (−0.9) −4.4 (24.1) −1.8 (28.8) 2.5 (36.5) 5.4 (41.7) 3.7 (38.7) −0.6 (30.9) −5.6 (21.9) −13.5 (7.7) −19.8 (−3.6) −27.5 (−17.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 43.2 (1.70) 38.9 (1.53) 52.6 (2.07) 59.3 (2.33) 72.6 (2.86) 95.3 (3.75) 77.4 (3.05) 92.3 (3.63) 85.8 (3.38) 82.9 (3.26) 80.1 (3.15) 59.6 (2.35) 840.1 (33.07) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) 9.8 9.4 11.0 13.0 13.5 13.7 11.2 10.4 10.4 10.9 11.3 11.0 135.6 Average snowy days (≥ 1.0 cm) 10.3 7.1 1.8 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.9 6.7 29.0 Average relative humidity (%) 82.5 76.4 70.3 67.5 68.3 69.7 69.1 72.1 77.7 81.3 83.6 84.8 75.3 Mean monthly sunshine hours 55.8 98.9 142.6 168.0 229.4 234.0 275.9 257.3 189.0 124.0 63.0 49.6 1,887.5 Mean daily daylight hours 9.2 10.4 11.9 13.6 15 15.7 15.3 14.1 12.5 10.9 9.5 8.7 12.2 Percent possible sunshine 23 39 43 45 54 55 63 63 54 41 26 23 47 Average ultraviolet index 1 2 3 5 7 8 8 7 5 3 1 1 4 Source 1: Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service[61][62] Source 2: Weather Atlas[64] Cityscape [edit] Panoramic view from Zagreb's Upper town. The most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder (1958) on Ban Jelačić Square, Cibona Tower (1987), and Zagrepčanka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb – istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).[65] In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower, Sky Office Tower and the tallest high-rise building in Zagreb Strojarska Business Center.[66][67] In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lanište expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.[68] Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4–8 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lanište or Kajzerica.[69] Surroundings [edit] Further information: Zagreb County, Prigorje, Hrvatsko Zagorje, and Turopolje Medvedgrad fortress The wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of Šćitarjevo. Picturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, Šestine, Gračani, and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, Šestine umbrellas, and gingerbread products. To the north is the Medvednica Mountain (Croatian: Zagrebačka gora), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament. Zagreb TV Tower From the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighboring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts, and a chairlift. The old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on the far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year. Zagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of Žumberak-Medvednica fault zone.[70] It's classified as an area of high seismic activity.[71] The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area.[72] The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes.[72] Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalinić stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.[73] In 2020 the city experienced a 5.5 magnitude earthquake, which damaged various buildings in the historic downtown area. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.

In 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County,[76] although it remains the administrative centre of both. The majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93.53% of the city's population (2021 census). The same census records around 49,605 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 12,035 Serbs (1.57%), 6,566 Bosniaks (0.86%), 3,475 Albanians (0.45%), 2,167 Romani (0.28%), 1,312 Slovenes (0.17%), 1,036 Macedonians (0.15%), 865 Montenegrins (0.11%), and a number of other smaller communities.[77] After the easing of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, thousands of foreign workers immigrated to Zagreb due to the shortage of labor force in Croatia. These workers primarily come from countries such as Nepal, the Philippines, India, and Bangladesh, as well as some European countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia.[78] City of Zagreb: Population trends 1857–2021 population 48266 54761 67188 82848 111565 136351 167765 258024 356529 393919 478076 629896 723065 777826 779145 790017 767131 1857 1869 1880 1890 1900 1910 1921 1931 1948 1953 1961 1971 1981 1991 2001 2011 2021 Sources: Croatian Bureau of Statistics publications v City districts [edit] Main article: Districts of Zagreb Districts of Zagreb Local committees of Zagreb, the second level of local self-government List of districts by area and population in 2021.[79] Since 14 December 1999 the City of Zagreb is divided into 17 city districts (gradska četvrt, pl. gradske četvrti): # District Area (km2) Population (2001)[80] Population (2011)[81] Population density (2011) 1.

The Zagreb Assembly is composed of 51 representatives, elected in the 2021 Zagreb local elections. According to the Constitution, the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia, has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county. It is also the seat of the Zagreb County which encircles Zagreb. The city administration bodies are the Zagreb City Assembly (Gradska skupština Grada Zagreba) as the representative body and the mayor of Zagreb (Gradonačelnik Grada Zagreba) who is the executive head of the city. The City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d'Hondt method in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them the president and vice-presidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives. Before 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to the law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the Zagreb Assembly city deputies have the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favor of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one-third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. 1⁄3 of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held). In the City of Zagreb, the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a "city with county rights", there isn't a State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government). City administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration. The city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly). Local government is organised in 17 city districts represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils.[89] Minority councils and representatives [edit] Directly elected minority councils and representatives are tasked with consulting tasks for the local or regional authorities in which they are advocating for minority rights and interests, integration into public life and participation in the management of local affairs.[90] At the 2023 Croatian national minorities councils and representatives elections Albanians, Bosniaks, Czechs, Hungarians, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Roma, Slovenes and Serbs of Croatia each fulfilled legal requirements to elect 25 members minority councils of the City of Zagreb while Bulgarians, Poles, Pannonian Rusyns, Russians, Slovaks, Italians, Turks, Ukrainians and Jews of Croatia elected individual representatives, with a representative of the Germans of Croatia remaining unelected due to the lack of candidates.[91] Kaptol Square with fountain Madonna and Angels.

Islamic religious organization of Croatia has the see in Zagreb. President is Mufti Aziz Hasanović. There used to be a mosque in the Meštrović Pavilion during World War II[147] at the Square of the Victims of Fascism, but it was relocated to the neighborhood of Borovje in Peščenica. Mainstream Protestant churches have also been present in Zagreb – Evangelical (Lutheran) Church and Reformed Christian (Calvinist) Church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is also present in the Zagreb neighborhood of Jarun whereas Jehovah's Witnesses have their headquarters in Central Zagreb.[148] In total there are around 40 non-Catholic religious organizations and denominations in Zagreb with their headquarters and places of worship across the city making it a large and diverse multicultural community. There is also significant Jewish history through the Holocaust. Economy [edit] Croatian Railways headquarters Important branches of industry are: production of electrical machines and devices, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, food and drink processing. Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe.[149] Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor, INA, Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city. The only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange (Croatian: Zagrebačka burza), which is located in Eurotower, one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers. According to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at $32,185 and $27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of US$18,686 and $15,758.[150] Croatian National Bank Dome of the Zagreb Old Stock Exchange Palace Croatian Chamber of Economy As of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna, about €870 (Croatian average is 5,679 kuna, about €740).[151][152] At the end of 2012, the average unemployment rate in Zagreb was around 9.5%.[153] 34% of companies in Croatia have headquarters in Zagreb, and 38.4% of the Croatian workforce works in Zagreb, including almost all banks, utility and public transport companies.[154][155][156] Companies in Zagreb create 52% of the total turnover and 60% of the total profit of Croatia in 2006 as well as 35% of Croatian export and 57% of Croatian import.[157][158] The following table includes some of the main economic indicators for the period 2011–2019, based on the data provided by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics.[159][160] A linear interpolation was used for the population data between 2011 and 2021. While data on the yearly averaged conversion rates between HRK, EUR and USD is provided by the Croatian National Bank.[161] Year Population Exchange rate (EUR : USD) GDP (nominal in mil.

The highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest.[162] The A1 starts at the Lučko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008[update] Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction[needs update]. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.[citation needed] Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.[163][164] A3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass, and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.[165] Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa.[166] It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe.[167] Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Goričan border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.[168] The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country.[169] The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Varaždin – Čakovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes.[170] The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.[170][171] Roads [edit] Part of the Zagreb bypass, Lučko interchange is the Zagreb's gateway to the Adriatic coast Zagrebačka Avenue The city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tuškanac, Kvaternik Square, Klaić Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east–west arteries, former Highway "Brotherhood and Unity", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagrebačka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city center. The avenues were supposed to alleviate the traffic problem, but most of them are nowadays gridlocked during rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day.[172][173][174] European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb. Bridges [edit] Homeland Bridge Zagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are: Name (English) Name (Croatian) Year Finished Type of bridge Road that goes over Other Information Podsused Bridge Podsusedski most 1982 Two-lane road bridge with a commuter train line (not yet completed) Samoborska Road Connects Zagreb to its close suburbs by a road to Samobor, the fastest route to Bestovje, Sveta Nedelja, and Strmec. Jankomir Bridge Jankomirski most 1958, 2006 (upgrade) Four lane road bridge Ljubljanska Avenue Connects Ljubljanska Avenue to the Jankomir interchange and Zagreb bypass. Adriatic Bridge Jadranski most 1981 Six lane road bridge (also carries tram tracks) Adriatic Avenue The most famous bridge in Zagreb. The bridge spans from Savska Street in the north to the Remetinec Roundabout in the south. Sava Bridge Savski most 1938 Pedestrian since the construction of the Adriatic Bridge Savska Road The official name at the time of building was New Sava bridge, but it is the oldest still standing bridge over Sava. The bridge is known among experts due to some construction details.[175] Liberty Bridge Most slobode 1959 Four lane road bridge Većeslav Holjevac Avenue It used to hold a pair of bus lanes, but due to the increasing individual traffic and better tram connections across the river, those were converted to normal lanes. Youth Bridge Most mladosti 1974 Six lane road bridge (also carries tram tracks) Marin Držić Avenue Connects eastern Novi Zagreb to the districts of Trnje, Peščenica, Donja Dubrava and Maksimir. Homeland Bridge Domovinski most 2007 Four-lane road bridge (also carries two bicycle and two pedestrian lanes; has space reserved for light railroad tracks) Radnička (Workers') Road This bridge is the last bridge built on the Sava river to date; it links Peščenica via Radnička street to the Zagreb bypass at Kosnica. It is planned to continue towards Zagreb Airport at Pleso and Velika Gorica, and on to state road D31 going to the south. There are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mičevec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zaprešić (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east). Two additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge. Public transportation [edit] Main Railway Station Public transportation in the city is organized in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas, and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail. The public transportation company ZET (Zagrebački električni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidized by the city council. The national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske željeznice, HŽ) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area and is a government-owned corporation. The funicular (uspinjača) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction. Taxi market has been liberalized in early 2018[176] and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market. Consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing. Tram network [edit] Main article: Trams in Zagreb Trams in Zagreb Zagreb Commuter Rail Zagreb has an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30–50 km/h (19–31 mph), but slow considerably during rush hour. On narrower streets the tracks are either shared with car traffic or separated by a painted yellow line, which can still be used by taxis, buses and emergency vehicles, whereas on larger avenues the tracks are situated inside green belts. An ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Končar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by TŽV Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new "TMK 2200", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.[177] Suburban rail network [edit] Main article: Zagreb Commuter Rail The commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east–west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.[178] A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samoborček was closed in the 1970s.[179] Air traffic [edit] Main article: Zagreb Airport Franjo Tuđman Airport Zagreb new passenger terminal Zagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG, ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft.[180] The airport had 3.45 million passengers in 2019 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5.5 million passengers. Zagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lučko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lučko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.[181] A third, small grass airfield, Buševec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.[182] Education [edit] Zagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia.[183][184] There are 5 public higher education institution and 9 private professional higher education schools.[185] There are 4 International Schools in Zagreb:[186] American International School of Zagreb (AISZ) The Learning Tree International Kindergarten (TLT) French School in Zagreb The German School in Zagreb.[187] University of Zagreb [edit] Main article: University of Zagreb Further information: List of universities in Croatia Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts National and University Library Founded in 1669, the University of Zagreb is the oldest continuously operating university in Croatia and one of the largest[188][189][190][191][192][193] and oldest universities in the Southeastern Europe. Ever since its foundation, the university has been continually growing and developing and now consists of 29 faculties, three art academies and the Croatian Studies Centre. More than 200,000 students have attained the Bachelor's degree at the university, which has also assigned 18,000 Master's and 8,000 Doctor's degrees.[194] As of 2011[update], the University of Zagreb is ranked among 500 Best Universities of the world by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities. Zagreb is the seat of two private universities: the Catholic University of Croatia and the Libertas International University. It also hosts numerous public and private polytechnics, colleges and higher professional schools.[which?] Gallery [edit] Ban Jelačić Square in Zagreb under the Habsburgs, before the 1880 Zagreb earthquake The Zagreb Cathedral renovated according to designs of Hermann Bollé, between 1902 and 1906 King Tomislav Square 1929 Zagreb in the 1930s Starčević square, first half of the 20th century Notable people [edit] Sanja Iveković Joško Gvardiol Borna Ćorić Josip Pivarić Nika Mühl Sandra Elkasević Nina Badrić Artists [edit] Lea Deutsch (1927–1943), child actress Kristina Krepela (born 1979), actress Sanja Iveković (born 1949), photographer, performer, sculptor and installation artist Jagoda Kaloper (1947–2016), painter and actress Igor Kordej (born 1957), comic book artist Darko Macan (born 1966), writer and illustrator Ivan Meštrović (1983–1962), sculptor, architect, and writer Velimir Neidhardt (born 1942), architect Vlado Milunić (1941–2022), architect, known for designing the Dancing House in Prague Vera Nikolić Podrinska (1886–1972), painter and baroness Srećko Puntarić (born 1952), cartoonist Josip Račić (1885–1908), painter Esad Ribić (born 1972), comic book artist Goran Sudžuka (born 1969), comic book artist Marino Tartaglia (1894–1984), painter Vladimir Varlaj (1895–1962), artist Zdravko Zupan (1950–2015), comic book creator and historian Footballers [edit] Milan Badelj (born 1989), football player Josip Brekalo (born 1998), football player Marcelo Brozović (born 1992), football player Tomislav Butina (born 1974), football player Ivan Čunčić (born 1985), football player Joško Gvardiol (born 2002), football player Tin Jedvaj (born 1995), football player Josip Juranović (born 1995), football player Andrej Kramarić (born 1991), football player Niko Kranjčar (born 1984), football player Jerko Leko (born 1980), football player Lovro Majer (born 1998), football player Jasmin Mujdža (born 1974), football player Mensur Mujdža (born 1984), football player Mislav Oršić (born 1992), football player Dubravko Pavličić (1967–2012), football player Josip Pivarić (born 1989), football player Marko Pjaca (born 1995), football player Dario Šimić (born 1975), football player Zvonimir Soldo (born 1967), football player Bernard Vukas (1927–1983), football player Other sportspeople [edit] Vasilije Calasan (born 1981), French racing driver Marin Čolak (born 1984), racing driver Borna Ćorić (born 1996), tennis player Krešimir Ćosić (1948–1995), basketball player Danko Cvjetićanin (born 1963), basketball player Josip Glasnović (born 1983), sports shooter, Olympic gold medal winner Zlatko Horvat (born 1984), handball player Filip Hrgović (born 1992), professional boxer Ivo Karlović (born 1979), tennis player Nenad Kljaić (born 1966), handball player Vjekoslav Kobešćak (born 1974), water polo player and coach Ivica Kostelić (born 1979), alpine ski racer Janica Kostelić (born 1982), alpine ski racer, four-time Olympic gold medalist Luka Lončar (born 1987), water polo player Iva Majoli (born 1977), tennis player Nikola Mektić (born 1988), tennis player, Olympic gold medal winner Nika Mühl (born 2001), basketball player Mirko Novosel (born 1938), basketball player Tomislav Paškvalin (born 1961), water polo player Sandra Elkasević (born 1990), discus thrower, won two gold medals at the Summer Olympics Dubravko Šimenc (born 1966), water polo player Martin Sinković (born 1989), rower, Olympic gold medal winner Valent Sinković (born 1988), rower, Olympic gold medal winner Tin Srbić (born 1996), artistic gymnast Manuel Štrlek (born 1988), handball player Igor Vori (born 1980), handball player Vedran Zrnić (born 1979), handball player Military [edit] Haim Bar-Lev (1924–1994), Israeli general and politician Music [edit] Zlatko Baloković (1895–1965), violinist Josipa Lisac (born 1950), Croatian singer Tajči (born 1970), Croatian singer, television show host Miljenko Matijević (born 1964), singer and songwriter;
