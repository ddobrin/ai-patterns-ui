Saint-Pierre ( French pronunciation: [sɛ̃ pjɛʁ] ⓘ) is the capital of the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, off the coast of the Canadian island of Newfoundland. Saint-Pierre is the more populous of the two communes (municipalities) making up Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Etymology [edit] The commune is named after Saint Peter, who is one of the patron saints of fishermen.[3] Geography [edit] The commune of Saint-Pierre is made up of the island of Saint-Pierre proper and several nearby smaller islands, such as L'Île-aux-Marins. Although containing nearly 90% of the inhabitants of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the commune of Saint-Pierre is considerably smaller in terms of area than the commune of Miquelon-Langlade, which lies to its northwest on Miquelon Island. The main settlement and communal seat is situated on the north side of a harbour called Barachois, which faces the Atlantic Ocean, on the Saint-Pierre Island's east coast. The mouth of the harbour is guarded by a small chain of islands. History [edit] Jacques Cartier claimed the islands for France in 1536, after they were discovered by the Portuguese in 1520. At the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the islands were turned over to Britain, only to be given back to France in 1816. Saint-Pierre was an outpost used to transport alcohol from Canada to the United States during Prohibition.[4] Until 1945, there existed a third commune in Saint Pierre and Miquelon: L'Île-aux-Marins. The commune of L'Île-aux-Marins was annexed by the commune of Saint-Pierre in 1945. Demographics [edit] The population of Saint-Pierre in 2022 was 5,223[2] many of whom are of Basque, Breton, Norman or Acadian descent.[citation needed] All inhabitants in the commune live on the island of Saint-Pierre proper. Government [edit] See also: Municipal governments in Saint Pierre and Miquelon The commune is led by a mayor and a council. The current mayor, elected in 2020, is Yannick Cambray.[5] Saint-Pierre under snow. Saint-Pierre on a cloudy day. Landmarks [edit] Close to the centre of the harbour's edge lie the Post office and Custom House (staffed by Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes), behind which is General Charles de Gaulle Square, the town's centre. Other prominent landmarks include the St. Pierre Cathedral, to the north of the square, rebuilt from 1905 to 1907 after a major fire, and the Pointe aux Canons Lighthouse, at the mouth of the harbour. Further north, close to the town's former hospital, is the Fronton Zazpiak Bat - an arena for the traditional Basque sport of pelota.

There is an attached senior home offering health services at the Maison de retraite Eglantine.[7] Additionally, there is a municipal library, opened in the 1970s, and a municipal sailing school, opened in 1986.[8] Transportation [edit] Saint-Pierre Airport, the international airport of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, is located south of the settlement of Saint-Pierre and is served by Air Saint-Pierre with flights both to Miquelon Airport, five Canadian airports and seasonal service to Paris. SPM Ferries provides ferry connections with Fortune, Newfoundland, Canada; the port in Miquelon town; and a quay at La Colo on Langlade.[9][10] BPE runs a ferry between Saint-Pierre town and Île aux Marins.[11][12] Transport around the island itself is either by private car, or by taxi, cars with drivers for hire, or car or bike rental. There are no public buses or railways on Saint Pierre.[13] Radio and television [edit] Radio Atlantique Radio France Outremer Education [edit] Public primary schools in the commune:[14] École maternelle Île aux Enfants École maternelle Henriette Bonin École élémentaire du Feu-Rouge - As of 2016 it had 172 students.[15] It is in the downtown area of the commune and is one nautical cable from the Île aux Enfants nursery.[16] Lycée-Collège d'État Émile Letournel is the public secondary school in the commune, with junior high, vocational high, and general senior high/sixth-form programmes.
