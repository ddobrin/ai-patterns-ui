Vientiane (Lao: ວຽງຈັນ, RTGS: Wiang Chan, pronounced [wíaŋ tɕàn]) is the capital and largest city of Laos. Situated on the banks of the Mekong River at the Thai border, it comprises the five urban districts of Vientiane Prefecture and had a population of 840,000 as of the 2023 Census. Established as the capital of the Lan Xang Kingdom in 1563, Vientiane served as the administrative center during French rule and retains colonial-era architecture alongside Buddhist landmarks such as Pha That Luang, a national symbol of Buddhism, and Haw Phra Kaew, which once housed the Emerald Buddha until its 18th-century relocation to Thailand. The city functions as Laos’ political, economic and transportation hub, emphasizing regional connectivity through infrastructure projects like the Laos-China Railway. This railway, a component of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, terminates in Vientiane after linking Kunming, China, and is slated to connect to Thailand’s rail network via the Mekong Railway Bridge.[4] Etymology [edit] "Vientiane" is the French spelling derived from the Lao Viangchan /wíaŋ tɕàn/.[5] The name was previously written "ວຽງຈັນທນ໌" (in Thai, เวียงจันทน์) and later sometimes written "ວຽງຈັນ". In Lao, viang (ວຽງ) refers to a 'walled city' whereas chan (ຈັນ, previously ຈັນທນ໌) derives from Sanskrit candana (चन्दन, /t͡ɕand̪ana/), 'sandalwood' and can be translated as the 'walled city of sandalwood'. Some believe it refers to the 'walled city of the moon' as chan can represent 'moon', and this was previously distinguished in writing as "ຈັນທຣ໌".[5][6] Other romanisations include "Viangchan" and "Wiangchan".[7] History [edit] Ban Tha Lat, Mon inscription (9th CE), was found in 1968, in an area where other pieces of archaeological evidence testified to a Mon presence. It is later at Ho Phra Kaeo Museum, Vientiane, Laos[8][9] Buddha sculptures at Pha That Luang Haw Phra Kaew or Temple of the Emerald Buddha Dvaravati city state kingdoms [edit] By the 6th century in the Chao Phraya River Valley, Mon peoples had coalesced to create the Dvaravati kingdoms. In the north, Haripunjaya (Lamphun) emerged as a rival power to the Dvaravati. By the 8th century the Mon had pushed north to create city states, in Fa Daet (what later is Kalasin, northeastern Thailand), Sri Gotapura (Sikhottabong) near Tha Khek, Laos, Muang Sua (Luang Prabang), and Chantaburi (Vientiane). In the 8th century CE, Sri Gotapura (Sikhottabong) was the “strongest of these early city states”, and controlled trade throughout the middle Mekong region. The city states were “loosely bound politically, but were culturally similar” and introduced Therevada Buddhism from Sri Lankan missionaries throughout the region.[10][11][12][13]: 6, 7 [14][15] Khmer domination [edit] A reference of the name Vientiane can be seen on a Vietnamese inscription of Duke Đỗ Anh Vũ, dated 1159 during the Khmer-Viet conflict. The inscription says that in 1135, Văn Đan (Vientiane), a vassal of Zhenla (Khmer Empire), invaded Nghe An, and was repelled by the Duke; the Duke led an army chased the invaders as far as Vũ Ôn? (unattested), and then returned with captives.[16]: 65  Lan Xang and French colonial rule [edit] In 1354, when Fa Ngum founded the kingdom of Lan Xang,[17]: 223  Vientiane became an administrative city. King Setthathirath officially established it as the capital of Lan Xang in 1563, to avoid Burmese invasion.[18] During French rule, the Vietnamese were encouraged to migrate to Laos, which resulted in 53% of the population of Vientiane being Vietnamese in the year 1943.[19] As late as 1945, the French drew up a plan to move Vietnamese population to 3 key areas (i.e. the Vientiane Plain, the Savannakhet region, and the Bolaven Plateau), which was interrupted by the Japanese invasion of Indochina.[19] If this plan had been implemented, according to Martin Stuart-Fox, the Lao might well have lost control over their own country.[19] During World War II, Vientiane fell and was occupied by Japanese forces, under the command of Sako Masanori.[20] On 9 March 1946, French paratroopers arrived and reoccupied the city on 24 April 1946.[21]: 736  Independence [edit] As the Laotian Civil War broke out between the Royal Lao Government and the Pathet Lao, Vientiane became “unstable”. In August 1960, Kong Le seized the capital and insisted that Souvanna Phouma become prime minister. In December, Phoumi Nosavan then seized the capital, overthrew the Phouma Government, and installed Boun Oum as prime minister. In 1975, Pathet Lao troops moved towards the city and Americans began evacuating the capital. On 23 August 1975, a contingent of 50 Pathet Lao women symbolically liberated the city.[21] Geography [edit] Climate [edit] Due to its dry winters and wet summers, Vientiane has a tropical savanna (Aw), a typical climate found in Laos, with a average high humidity rate ranges from 70-84%. The city has two distinct seasons. The wet season, mostly starts from april to september, featuring hot and humid weather with average temperature of 28°C (82°F). The season received 1,395 mm (5.4 in) of rainfall annually. The dry season, lasted from october to march, featuring drier and cooler temperature. The highest temperature ever recorded was 42.6°C (108.7°F) in april while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 2.4°C (36.3°F) in january. The city received on average 2,200 hours of sunshine yearly.

An attraction is Pha That Luang, a national cultural monument of Laos and 1 of its stupas. It was originally built in 1566 by King Setthathirath and was restored in 1953. The golden stupa is 45 metres (148 ft) tall and is believed to contain a relic of the Buddha.[28] The Wat Si Muang temple was built on the ruins of a Khmer Hindu shrine, the remains of which can be seen behind the ordination hall.[29] It was built in 1563 and is believed to be guarded by the spirit of a local girl, Nang Si. Legend tells that Nang Si, who was pregnant at the time, leapt to her death as a sacrifice, just as the pillar was being lowered into the hole. In front of the temple stands a statue of King Sisavang Vong.[29] The memorial monument, Patuxai, built between 1957 and 1968, is a landmark in the city.[28] Buddha Park was built in 1958 by Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat and contains a collection of Buddhist and Hindu sculptures, scattered amongst gardens and trees. The park is 28 kilometres (17 mi) south of Vientiane at the edge of the Mekong River.[30] Other sites include: Haw Phra Kaew, former temple, later a museum and shops Lao National Museum Kaysone Phomvihane Museum Talat Sao, a morning market That Dam, a large stupa Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan, a Buddhist monastery Wat Sri Chomphu Ong Tue, a Buddhist temple Wat Si Saket, Buddhist wat Wat Sok Pa Luang, a Buddhist temple Settha Palace Hotel, established 1932 The Sanjiang Market[31] Vientiane from Patuxai Education [edit] The National University of Laos, 1 of 3 universities in the country, is in Vientiane.[32] International schools include: Vientiane International School Lycée français international de Vientiane Josué-Hoffet (French)[33] Russian Embassy School in Vientiane Broadcasting [edit] Lao National Radio has a mediumwave transmitter with a 277-metre guyed mast at 18°20′33″N 102°27′01″E﻿ / ﻿18.34250°N 102.45028°E﻿ / 18.34250; 102.45028. China Radio International (CRI) FM 93.0.[34] Economy [edit] Vientiane has experienced economic growth from foreign investment.[35] In 2011, the stock exchange opened with 2 listed company stocks, with the cooperation of South Korea.[36] Transportation [edit] Further information: Transportation in Laos By bus [edit] Older taxis in Vientiane are being replaced by newer Chinese-made cars, like this Soueast Lioncel.[37] There are regular bus services connecting Vientiane Bus Station with the rest of the country. In Vientiane, regular bus services around the city are provided by Vientiane Capital State Bus Enterprise.[38] By rail [edit] Vientiane railway station A metre gauge railway link over the first bridge was formally inaugurated on 5 March 2009, previously ending at Thanaleng Railway Station, in Dongphosy village (Vientiane Prefecture), 20 km east of Vientiane.[39][40] As of November 2010, Lao officials plan to convert the station into a cargo rail terminal for freight trains, allowing cargo to be transported from Bangkok into Laos more cheaply than via road.[41] The Boten–Vientiane railway (sometimes referred to as the China–Laos railway or Laos–China railway) is a 414 kilometres (257 mi) 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge electrified railway in Laos, running between the capital Vientiane and the town of Boten on the border with China.
