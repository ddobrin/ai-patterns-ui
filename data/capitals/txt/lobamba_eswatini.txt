The subject of this article is a settlement that was created by Sobhuza II in the northwest section of the country.[11][nb 1] In 1903, following the Boer Wars, the British government took control of Eswatini and it was then ruled by a regent. In 1921 King Sobhuza II became leader of Eswatini, which was still under the British government's control.[15] Eswatini became independent of the British government on September 6, 1968, which was announced at a cattle byre in Lobamba by Prince Makhosini. He was the country's first prime minister and the great-grandson of Sobhuza I. With its independence, Eswatini was a member in its own right of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), British Commonwealth, and the United Nations.[16] It was made a constitutional monarchy under Sobhuza II,[17] who lived in the royal residence, or kraal, in Lobamba.[17] Government [edit] Mswati III, King of Eswatini April 1986–present Lobamba is the legislative seat of the Eswatini government.[5] Parliament of Eswatini [edit] Main article: Parliament of Eswatini It was made a branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association on January 1, 1965, and its date of independence was January 1, 1968.
