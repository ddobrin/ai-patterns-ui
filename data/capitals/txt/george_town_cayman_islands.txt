It was named after King George III. As of 2022[update], the city had a population of 40,957,[1] making it the largest city (by population) of all the British Overseas Territories.[2] George Town is the heart of the Cayman Islands financial services industry (there are close to 600 Bank and Trust companies in the Cayman Islands). The Caymanian government offices are located in the city. According to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2016, George Town is classed as a Beta city.[3] Government [edit] Cayman Islands flag flies at its foreign office The Caymanian government offices are located in George Town. These offices include the Parliament of the Cayman Islands, the Court Houses and the Government Administration Building. The Government Administration Building houses the offices of the Premier and other members of Cabinet, the Deputy Governor and his staff as well as other elected officials and civil servants. The former Old Courts Building located at the corner of Shedden Road and Harbour Drive is now the National Museum of Grand Cayman. The building was built more than 150 years ago and has served the Caymanian government not only as a court building but as a jail and the island's first official Post Office. The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory; however, they are given special autonomy when dealing with domestic affairs. Foreign affairs are the responsibility of the British appointed Governor and the British Government. The British Army will also be called to defend or assist the islands in the event of a natural disaster or military conflict. It is also trusted that the United States would assist the islands in time of need if the UK requests, seeing that the US is closer in proximity to the islands than the UK. Politics [edit] The politics of George Town is dominated by the People's Progressive Movement, who won 5 out of the 7 electoral districts in the city during the 2021 general election.[4] They believe in introducing a nationwide welfare program, an increased financial presence in the UK, EU and US, reduced interference by the UK in domestic affairs and funding sustainable development projects across the islands.[5] Demographics [edit] Aerial view of George Town George Town’s residents by background[1] Nationalities percent Cayman Islands   37.9% Jamaica   27.0% The Philippines   8.1% United Kingdom   7% United States   5.3% Canada   4.0% Honduras   3.5% India   2.7% South Africa   1.5% Nicaragua   1.1% Ireland   1% Other   0.9% 49.6% of the Cayman Islands population live in George Town.[1] It has recorded residents from more than one hundred countries. 37.9% of George Town's residents are Caymanian, and 63.8% are immigrants and permanent residents.
