It ships most of the country's chief export, coffee, as well as cotton and tin ore. Bujumbura was formerly the country's political capital. In late December 2018, Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would follow through on a 2007 promise to return Gitega its former political capital status, with Bujumbura remaining as economical capital and center of commerce. A vote in the Parliament of Burundi made the change official on 16 January 2019, with all branches of government expected to move to Gitega within three years.[3][needs update] History [edit] See also: Timeline of Bujumbura This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2024) Bujumbura grew from a small village after it became a military post in German East Africa in 1889. After World War I it was made the administrative center of the Belgian League of Nations mandate of Ruanda-Urundi. The name was changed from Usumbura to Bujumbura when Burundi became independent in 1962.[4] Since independence, Bujumbura was the scene of frequent fighting between the country's two main ethnic groups, with Hutu militias opposing the Tutsi-dominated Burundi Army during the Burundian Civil War. Geography [edit] Lake Tanganyika Bujumbura is on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, the second deepest lake in the world after Lake Baikal. The city also lies at the mouth of the Ruzizi River and the smaller Mutimbuzi, Ntahangwa, Muha and Kanyosha Rivers. Climate [edit] Bujumbura has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw)[5] bordering on hot semi-arid (BSh). There are distinct wet and dry seasons; the wet season being from October to April. Being close to the equator, average temperatures in the city vary little over the year, though they are affected by its altitude. The high temperature is around 29 °C (84 °F) and the low around 19 °C (66 °F).

It is further divided into three communes, or neighborhoods, each with its own council and council leader.[8] Each of the three current communes were created from the 13 former communes (currently sub-communes), due to a 2014 reorganization, which in turn are further sub-divided into villages or zones:[9] Commune of Muha Kanyosha Quarters: Gisyo-Nyabaranda, Gisyo, Musama I, Musama II, Musama III, Musama IV, Musama V, Nyabugete, Kizingwe-Bihara, Nkenga-Busoro, Ruziba, Kajiji Kinindo Quarters: Kibenga, Kinanira I, Kinanira II, Kinanira III, Kinanira IV, Kinindo, Zeimet-OUA Musaga [sv] Quarters: Gasekebuye-Gikoto, Gitaramuka, Kamesa, Kinanira I, Kinanira II Commune of Mukaza Buyenzi Quarters: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII Bwiza [fr] Quarters: Bwiza I, Bwiza II, Bwiza III, Bwiza IV, Kwijabe I, Kwijabe II, Kwijabe III Nyakabiga [fr] Quarters: Kigwati, Nyakabiga I, Nyakabiga II, Nyakabiga III Rohero [sv] Quarters: Centre Ville, Rohero I - Gatoke, Kabondo, Mutanga-Sud - Sororezo, Asiatique, I.N.S.S, Rohero II, Kiriri-Vugizo Commune of Ntahangwa Buterere Quarters: Buterere I, Buterere II A, Buterere II B, Kabusa, Kiyange, Maramvya, Mubone, Mugaruro, Kiyange Cibitoke [it] Quarters: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII Gihosha Quarters: Gasenyi, Gihosha, Gikungu, Kigobe, Mutanga-Nord, Muyaga, Nyabagere, Taba, Winterekwa Kamenge [fr] Quarters: Gikizi, Gituro, Heha, Kavumu, Mirango I, Mirango II, Songa, Teza, Twinyoni Kigobe Quarters: Kigobe Nord, Kigobe Sud Kinama Quarters: Bubanza, Buhinyuza, Bukirasazi I, Bukirasazi II, Bururi, Carama, Gitega, Kanga, Muramvya, Muyinga, Ngozi, Ruyigi, SOCARTI.

Goods may be carried by road via Rwanda, or by the lake and then by road or rail via Tanzania, Congo or Zambia. 80% of Burundi's external trade is carried via the last three routes, using the Port of Bujumbura.[11] The port manages receipt and delivery of exports and imports, whether carried by ship or by truck. As of 2011 more than 90% of cargo handled was imports, of which about 60% entered by ship and 40% by truck.[12] Bujumbura Central Market was in the city centre, along Rwagasore Avenue. During the 1993 ethnic violence in Burundi, citizens became less likely to travel far from the city centre, and markets in neighbouring communities lost their business to the central market.[citation needed] At dawn on 27 January 2013 a serious fire ravaged the central market.[13] Due to the poor emergency response, the fire lasted for hours, resulting in a serious blow to local exchanges. Hundreds of vendors, local and foreign, lost their goods to the fire and the reported looting.[14] Politics [edit] List of mayors of Bujumbura Gérard Kibinakanwa, 1962–1967[15] Thérence Ndikumasabo, 1967–1969 Pie Kanyoni, 1969–1975 and 1976–1977 Charles Kabunyoma, 1976 Juvénal Madirisha, 1977–1979 Germain Nkwirikiye, 1979–1981 Lucien Sakubu, 1981–1987 Léonidas Ndoricimpa, 1987–1991 Arthémon Mvuyekure, 1991–1992 Anatole Kanyenkiko, 1992–1993 Léonce Sinzinkayo, 1993–1994 Pie Ntiyankundiye, 1994–2002 Pontien Niyongabo, 2002–2005 Célestin Sebutama, 2005–2007 Elias Buregure, 2007 Evrard Giswaswa, c. 2008–2012[16] Saidi Juma, c. 2012[17] Freddy Mbonimpa, 2015–2020 Jimmy Hatungimana, 2020– View of Bujumbura Sports [edit] Bujumbura is the location for the city's multisport Intwari stadium.
