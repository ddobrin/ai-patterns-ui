S. Virgin Islands. It is located on the island's southern shore at the head of Saint Thomas Harbor. The town is known for its historic sites, Danish colonial architecture, harbor, and shopping.[4][5] In 2020, it had a population of 8,194,[6] making it the most densely populated town in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It has a deep-water harbor that was once a haven for pirates (including Blackbeard) and is now one of the busiest ports of call for cruise ships in the Caribbean.[4] About 1.5 million-plus cruise ship passengers land there annually, and hundreds of ferries and yachts pass by each week. Protected by Hassel Island, the harbor has docking and fueling facilities, machine shops, and shipyards and was a U.S. submarine base until 1966. Name [edit] The town was named Charlotte Amalie in honor of Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel in 1691. Known for its many beer halls, the town was founded in 1666 as Taphus (Danish for 'beer house' or most literally 'tap house'). In 1691 the town was renamed Charlotte Amalie in honor of Danish King Christian V's wife, Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel (1650–1714). Between 1921 and 1936, the town was called St. Thomas by the United States. In 1936 the capital was recognized as Charlotte Amalie. Official designation [edit] Like the rest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the town of Charlotte Amalie has no local government and is directly administered by the territorial government. However, it has boundaries defined by the Virgin Islands Code, and it is recognized as a town or census-designated place (CDP) by the U.S. Census Bureau.[7] Charlotte Amalie sits between the CDPs of Charlotte Amalie West and Charlotte Amalie East;[8] together, these three CDPs comprise the subdistrict of Charlotte Amalie (or "the City"). Neighborhoods [edit] Intersection of Dronningens Gade (English: Queen's Street aka Main Street) and Raadets Gade (Council's Street) early Sunday morning. Downtown Charlotte Amalie [edit] Downtown Charlotte Amalie is divided into three historical quarters, reflecting its Danish colonial past: Kongens Kvarter (English: King's Quarter): This area contains many historic government buildings, Charlotte Amalie harbor defense structures and landmarks. It is central to administrative activities during the colonial period and today. Government House, the Virgin Islands Capitol Building, Superior Court of the Virgin Islands (in the Alexander A Farrelly Justice Complex) and United States District Court of the Virgin Islands (in the Ron Delugo Federal Building), Emancipation Garden as well as Fort Christian are located in this quarter. Dronningens Kvarter (English: Queen's Quarter): This quarter features residential areas as well as the downtown commercial shopping district. Kronprinsens Kvarter (English: Crown Prince's Quarter): This area historically housed various community as well as merchant activities like the sale of slaves and produces at the Rothchild Francis Market Square. It also includes a mix of residential and business spaces. The transitions between the quarters in downtown Charlotte Amalie are not always clearly marked. However, the best way to identify these changes is by following Virgin Islands Route 308. This road, which passes through all three quarters, provides a practical guide to their boundaries. In Kongens Kvarter, Route 308 is known as Nørre Gade (English: North Street). It begins at the easternmost side of the quarter, at the intersection with Bjerge Gade (English: Mountain Street) Route 314. Here, the road is a two-lane street. As you enter Dronningens Kvarter, the road becomes Dronningens Gade (English: Queen Street) and transitions into a one-way street heading west. In Kronprinsens Kvarter, Route 308 changes its name to Kronprinsens Gade (English: Crown Prince Street) and returns to being a two-lane road. Finally, as Route 308 exits downtown Charlotte Amalie, it becomes Harwood Highway, marking the end of the historic downtown district at the west end. Downtown Charlotte Amalie is primarily bordered on the south by Virgin Islands Highway 30, commonly known as Veterans Drive or the Waterfront Highway. The northern boundary is less clearly defined, but a useful rule of thumb is that once the street names transition from Danish to English, you are likely outside of downtown Charlotte Amalie as downtown Charlotte Amalie is the only area of the island of St. Thomas with street names in Danish. Frenchtown [edit] Frenchtown is a distinctive neighborhood and fishing community within the town limits of Charlotte Amalie, located southwest of downtown and just south of Highway 30. Originally settled by French immigrants from the island of Saint-Barthélemy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it has retained a strong French-Caribbean influence that is evident in its traditions, cuisine, and way of life. Frenchtown is known for its vibrant French heritage, with many families in the area tracing their ancestry to Saint-Barthélemy. The community celebrates French traditions, including culinary and religious practices. Historically, Frenchtown was a fishing village, and fishing remains an important part of its identity. While downtown Charlotte Amalie is known for its Danish street names, Frenchtown stands out with its French-named streets, reflecting its rich French-Caribbean heritage. St. Thomas, Subdistricts, towns, and CDPs Landmarks [edit] Charlotte Amalie has many buildings of historical importance and other important landmarks: St. Thomas Synagogue, the second oldest synagogue in the western hemisphere and oldest under the United States flag;[9] Frederick Lutheran Church; Blackbeard's Castle, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, built in the 17th century by the Danes; Bluebeard's Castle, built in the 17th century by the Danes; Fort Christian, the oldest standing structure in the Virgin Islands Archipelago; Emancipation Park, which has a copy of the Liberty Bell and a statue of a freed slave blowing a conch shell.[10] History [edit] Blackbeard's Castle (Skytsborg) was built on Government Hill in 1679 and is today a U.S. National Historic Landmark. Charlotte Amalie in 1851, painted by Fritz Melbye Government House in the 1950s Early history [edit] Archaeological records indicate that the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands have been home to native people groups, including the Taíno, Arawak, Kalinago/Carib, and the Ciboney people.[11] Several of these groups lived in present-day Charlotte Amalie in small fishing communities. When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1493, during his second voyage to the Americas, the archipelago was still inhabited by Carib, Arawak, Ciboney, and Taíno peoples. As was the case in most of the Americas, these native populations died relatively quickly from disease when the Europeans settled. While Columbus claimed the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands for Spain, early Spanish settlers were focused more on Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. As a result, St. Thomas remained unprotected by the Spanish for many years, which left Charlotte Amalie's sheltered coves to be frequented by pirates, like Blackbeard, as well as mariners and other European settlers.[12] 17th century [edit] The Danish West India Company chartered Charlotte Amalie in 1671 after King Christian V decided to secure them for plantations. As early as in 1672, the Danish government began the construction of Fort Christian on Saint Thomas Harbor in Charlotte Amalie. In 1675, the Danes constructed four pubs near the water's edge on the western side of the Fort. The Danish government supplied convicts to work the plantations but soon allowed colonists from neighboring islands to settle there, as well as to permit the importation of slaves from Africa. In 1680, there were more black African slaves than white European settlers.[13] Adjacent Water and Buck Islands served as pasture lands for the town, and Taphus was renamed Charlotte Amalie in 1691 after King Christian V's wife. It was the main port of the Virgin Islands Archipelago and was connected to about 50 plantations by one road, which remains the main highway today. 18th century [edit] In the early 18th century, more than 3000 white settlers lived in town, and sugar production and slave trading were the economic mainstay. After the Danish government wanted direct administration of the archipelago in 1754, the capital was moved from Charlotte Amalie to Christiansted on the Island of Saint Croix. That partly made the economy in town to transition from slave trading and agriculture to general commerce. The slight could not hamper the town's growth, as merchants profiteered in arms and rum trades to belligerent countries. In 1764, Charlotte Amalie was declared a free port by King Frederick V, and the town became the busiest harbor in the Caribbean. The American Revolution in the 1770s was good news for the town, as it was thriving times for the local businessfolk. The town began to be filled by immigrants from Europe, Africa and the Caribbean, most of them from other islands of the Lesser Antilles. By 1778, the Danish government had strengthened their military position by building Bluebeard's Castle and Blackbeard's Castle, lookout towers on the crests of the two hills by the town. The town prospered as a free port and United States, Danish, Sephardic, German, French, British, Italian and Spanish importing houses operated here. At the end of the 18th century, United States founding father and future architect of the United States Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, decided the town was so wealthy that "gold moved through the streets in wheel-barrows".[14] At one point, the town of Charlotte Amalie in the Danish West Indies was the second-largest city in the Danish Realm, only smaller than the capital of Copenhagen. [15] 19th century [edit] A growing share of the West Indian trade passed through the port in the beginning of the 1800s, and the rise of steamships made Charlotte Amalie an ideal coaling station for ships sailing between North- and South America. In 1804, Charlotte Amalie was struck by a horrendous fire that destroyed more than 1200 homes and stores throughout the town. Two more fires came in 1805 and 1806, and the densely settled town lost another thousand buildings. Neighboring islands gradually began importing coal directly from producers, and Charlotte Amalie was sidestepped in trade in the early 1800s. The abolition of slavery in 1848 further diminished Charlotte Amalie's commercial role and the town suffered from a brutal recession, as did most of the Caribbean following abolition. During the American Civil War in the early 1860s, the town evolved into a smuggling center for ships running the federal blockade of ports in the Confederacy. As an acknowledgment of the port's smuggling success, the Danish government decided to move the capital of the archipelago back to Charlotte Amalie in 1871. The latter half of the 1800s was also soon hit by a cholera epidemic that killed thousands.[13] Charlotte Amalie fell into an unsuccessful dormancy until the United States purchased the islands from Denmark in 1917. 20th century [edit] In 1915, the United States became interested in buying the U.S. Virgin Islands. They were concerned over German infiltration in the Lesser Antilles. The U.S. purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917 for $25 million. Charlotte Amalie was under U.S. Navy rule until 1931. The United States decided to make Charlotte Amalie the main headquarters of the renamed United States Virgin Islands. Charlotte Amalie Waterfront, 2011 When American tourists were barred from Cuba in 1960, some began visiting Charlotte Amalie instead.[16] As an unincorporated territory of the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands became a haven for mainland United States citizens seeking luxury vacations or a second home in the Caribbean. During the mid 20th century, resorts began to be built and direct flights from the U.S. to Charlotte Amalie increased tourism. During the last half of the century, Charlotte Amalie experienced extraordinary economic growth, largely as a consequence of being a U.S. territory with a growing U.S. tourism. The tourism has not only led to a growing economy, but also to preservation and conversion of historic buildings and homes. Many ancient commercial buildings were made into restaurants and shops. During the 1980s and 90s, many buildings were restored to how they looked 200 years ago.[citation needed] The tourism industry has thrived on the island, driving the economy of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but limited flatland space in the mountainous terrain constrains Charlotte Amalie's economic and population growth. The spread of hilltop homes overlooking the Caribbean crystal blue waters began trending in the 1960s as well. Geography [edit] Map of the U.S. Virgin Islands Located mid-island on the south shore of the mountainous Island of Saint Thomas, Charlotte Amalie stretches about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) around Saint Thomas Harbor from the Havensight district, where the cruise ships dock in Charlotte Amalie East, to the Crown Bay (Sub Base) area in Charlotte Amalie West. The red walls of the Danish Fort Christian and the open space of Emancipation Garden and the Vendor's Market are the center of downtown. Many of the town's historic buildings and businesses stand on the slopes of Government Hill just north of Emancipation Garden. This is "Kongens Quarter". To the west, spanning the area between Waterfront Dr and Dronningens Gade (Main Street), are a score of alleys, each lined with colonial warehouse buildings that have been turned into stores and urban malls. Protected by the peaks of Water Island and Hassel Island, Saint Thomas Harbor makes a deep indentation in the Island. The bay affords vistas from lookout points as high as 1,500 feet (460 m), including for instance Drake's Seat. Charlotte Amalie is built on three low volcanic spurs called Frenchman Hill (Foretop Hill), Berg Hill (Maintop), and Government Hill (Mizzentop).[17] Charlotte Amalie is located at coordinates 18°21' north and 64°57' west. Climate [edit] Charlotte Amalie's average year round temperatures range from 75 to 90 °F (23.9 to 32.2 °C) and the climate is classified as a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw). The town has a short dry season that runs from January through March and a wet season that covers the remaining nine months, though technically June, with a monthly average precipitation of 2.35 inches or 59.7 millimeters could be considered a dry season month. While Charlotte Amalie does have a lengthy wet season, outside the months of September through November, the town generally does not see the heavy precipitation that is prevalent in many other cities with a tropical climate. The town is generally very warm and humid. Average temperatures in Charlotte Amalie are at a near constant, with average high temperatures at about 88 °F (31.1 °C) and average low temperatures at about 75 °F (23.9 °C).

A 76.2% majority are Afro-Caribbean, while a minority of 13.1% are white. About one percent is of Asian descent.[20] Religion [edit] St. Thomas Synagogue According to the CIA World Factbook, more than 95 percent of the people describe themselves as Christians. 42% are Baptist, 34% Catholic and 17% Episcopalian.[20] There are also Jewish, Hindu and Muslim populations of European, Middle Eastern, and Caribbean origin. Historic Places of Worship [edit] Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral The town's Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Thomas, which covers the American Virgin Islands and is the sole suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Washington (D.C.). Saint Thomas is home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the Western Hemisphere as Sephardic Jews began to settle the island in the 18th century as traders and merchants. The St. Thomas Synagogue in Charlotte Amalie is the second oldest synagogue in the western hemisphere and oldest under the United States flag.[21] Frederick Evangelical Lutheran Church Anglican Church US Virgin Islands, Frederick Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1666. The present structure was completed in 1793. The Episcopal Diocese of the Virgin Islands (Anglican Church) is a diocese of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA/T.E.C) which includes both the United States Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands. The diocese is a part of Province II of the Episcopal Church. Languages and literacy [edit] More than 95 percent of the population are literate.[22] Although English is the official language, most people speak a dialect called Virgin Islands Creole, which differs from standard English in many ways. Virgin Islands Creole is used informally and standard United States English (spoken with a uniquely Virgin Islands accent) is usually preferred in school, at work and in more formal conversations. Most older children and adults can quickly switch between Virgin Islands Creole and United States English. Spanish is spoken by 16.8% and French Patois is spoken by 6.6% of the town's population.[23][24] While Spanish is spoken by migrants from Puerto Rico (US) and immigrants from the Dominican Republic, creoles are spoken by immigrants from St. Barthelemy, Dominica and Haiti; Dutch and Papiamento are spoken by immigrants from Saba, Aruba, St. Maarten and Curaçao. Economy [edit] Intersection of Dronningens Gade (English: Queen's Street aka Main Street) and Nye Gade (English: New Street) early Sunday morning. The economy is based on tourism, handicrafts, jewelry, and the production of rum, bay rum, and jams. As well as being the USVI's political capital, "the City" is the port capital of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Charlotte Amalie is the third most popular cruise ship destination in the Caribbean Sea.[25] Up to eleven cruise ships can occupy the harbor on any given day, though usually there are about five.[26] Tourism [edit] About 1.5 plus million cruise ship passengers visit on average per year.[27] Tourist attractions include Blackbeard's Castle which is one of the most visited attractions in the town,[28] Bluebeard's Castle, 17th-century Fort Christian, the green and distinctive Legislature Building, the 99 Steps Stairway, Emancipation Garden, Market Square, Seven Arches Museum, St. Thomas Synagogue, Frederick Lutheran Church, and the Weibel Museum. Tourists usually either arrive by airplane at the Cyril E. King Airport, approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Charlotte Amalie, the Crown Bay cruise ship port, or the Havensight cruise port. In the 21st century, Charlotte Amalie has benefited from proximity to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where passengers from larger aircraft can transfer to smaller aircraft for a 30-minute flight to Charlotte Amalie. The town has also become a jumping-off place for other islands in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In this century, there have been more high-speed ferries each year leaving Charlotte Amalie for St. Croix, St. John and Tortola.[citation needed] A seaplane wharf is near the west end of the inner harbor; the planes take passengers to St. Croix. Because of its duty-free policies, the Territory is sometimes referred to as "the duty-free capital of the world".[29] Charlotte Amalie has more jewelry shops and perfume vendors than anywhere else in the Caribbean and is known for its outdoor shopping Vendors' Plaza. On Main Street (Dronningens Gade) there are many major shops, including Tiffany, Breitling, Rolex, and Fresh Produce. Havensight and Crown Bay docks are other shopping areas, with a number of stores adjacent to the cruise ship docks. Along Dronningens Gade are more than 400 shops, most of them selling jewelry and in the Havensight Mall. The western end (near the intersection with Strand Gade) is called "Market Square." Once the site of the biggest slave market auctions in the Caribbean Basin, today it is an open-air cluster of stalls where resident farmers and gardeners gather occasionally to sell their produce. Culture [edit] Corner of Dronningens Gade (English: Queen's Street aka Main Street) and Raadats Gade (English: Council's Street) in Charlotte Amalie St. Thomas The culture is a mixture of American (US) socio-economic activities- and Afro/Latino-Caribbean culture, with an influence from Danish colonial history. There are American fast food chains in the town, as well as local restaurants serving only Caribbean cuisine. Grocery stores contain items from the US mainland, and local items such as rum. Seafood and local produce can be found at open-air markets. Danish influence [edit] Named Charlotte Amalie in honor of the wife of Danish King Christian V, the Danish influence is strong. The heritage is predominant in several ways in Charlotte Amalie today. The Danes left castles, cemeteries, churches, forts, town homes, sugar mills and plantation houses that are still standing. Many geographical names are kept in Danish and many locals have Danish heritage.[30] The most widely spoken language, Virgin Islands Creole, has many words and expressions left from the Danish language. For instance, Danish words like "skål" (toast), "bjerg" (mountain) and "frikadeller" (meatballs) are commonly used.[31] Much of the historic colonial architecture is still standing and words like "street" are more commonly referred to by the Danish translation "gade". French Heritage Museum Architecture [edit] Charlotte Amalie has the largest collection of colonial buildings in the Caribbean.[25] Most of the buildings are classic Caribbean adaptions of English Georgian architecture built by the Danes, dating to the 1830s. Museums and Art Galleries [edit] A list of Museums and Art Galleries in the town of Charlotte Amalie: Fort Christian Saint Thomas Historical Trust Museum Camille Pissarro Gallery[32] Seven Arches Museum [33] Weibel Memorial Museum French Heritage Museum 81C Art Gallery and Cafe Sports [edit] Lionel Roberts Stadium Lionel Roberts Stadium is a multi-use stadium in Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands. The stadium has a capacity of 9,000. Transportation [edit] Waterfront Drive There are three main roads in Charlotte Amalie. Waterfront Drive, also called Veteran's Drive, fronts the harbor and extends from Havensight Mall to Frenchtown. This four-lane road is best navigated by car or taxi. "Main Street", also called Dronningens Gade, Norre Gade, run parallel to the waterfront. "Back Street" or Wimmelskafts Gade, is one block farther inland, parallel to the shoreline. Street names in the town are remnants of the Island's Danish past. Charlotte Amalie is notable for being the only U.S. capital city (either of a territory or state) where traffic drives on the left side of the road – this despite a previous fourteen-year period of attempting to conform to the United States' right side principle, which was abandoned and reverted to left side by popular demand. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is the only United States jurisdiction of any kind where the rule of the road is to drive on the left. However, virtually all passenger vehicles are left hand drive due to imports of U.S. vehicles. making the driving experience in the USVI very similar to the situation in The Bahamas, and for largely the same vehicle import reasons. Airports [edit] A Seaborne Airlines Seaplane The Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base Terminal The Cyril E. King Airport serves the residents of Charlotte Amalie but it is located in Charlotte Amalie West. The only air transport available in the Charlotte Amalie is the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base (IATA: SPB, FAA LID: VI22), also known as St. Thomas Seaplane Base. It is located just east of Frenchtown on Highway 30. This private-use airport is owned by the Virgin Islands Port Authority. At this base, a seaplane shuttle service is operated between Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Croix and Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas Ferry Terminals [edit] Edward Wilmoth Blyden Marine Terminal The Edward William Blyden Ferry Terminal, located next to the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base, serves as the only ferry terminal to surrounding islands from the town of Charlotte Amalie. From the terminal nonstop service to Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands and Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. To accommodate the entry of foreign travelers entering into US Virgin Islands, the terminal has U S Customs and Border Patrol Offices and officers stationed at the terminal. Public Transit [edit] VITRAN bus on St Thomas. The VITRAN (Virgin Island Public Transit) system is a comprehensive public transportation system serving the U.S. Virgin Islands. The system encompasses various modes of transportation, including buses, paratransit services and ferries. The buses and paratransit services are the only modes of transport that are available within the Charlotte Amalie however. Public Fixed Path Transit [edit] All VITRAN [34] bus routes on St. Thomas serve the town of Charlotte Amalie. Below of the list of bus routes, current and past: VITRAN 101 - City/UVI [suspended], VITRAN 102 - City/Subbase/Airport [suspended], VITRAN 201 - Bordeaux, VITRAN 301 - Contant/Donoe/Hidden Valley, VITRAN 401 - Contant/Red Hook via Smith Bay, VITRAN 501 - Contant/Bovoni via Tutu Park Mall, VITRAN 601 - Contant/Old & New Tutu via Tutu Park Mall. Public Paratransit Service [edit] The paratransit service provided by VITRAN is a specialized transportation system designed to serve individuals with disabilities who cannot access the regular fixed public transit services. This service adheres to the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), ensuring accessible transportation for elderly, those with mobility issues and disabled residents and visitors. This VITRAN service include door-to-door or curb-to-curb transport and advanced reservation systems at half the price of the fixed path transist. Alternative Fixed Path Transit [edit] Safaris "Safaris", as they are called locally, are open air taxis mounted onto the back of a pickup truck.[35] Because VITRAN bus transit is not very efficient, some "safari" drivers operate on several VITRAN bus fixed paths including the suspended VITRAN 101 route. Those that do are locally called "Dollar Ride", a term used to describe the original fare charged that matched the old VITRAN fee. Those following a VITRAN fixed path, charge the same amount as VITRAN buses (plus bag/luggage fee) as they are required to do by the rate set by the Taxi Cab Commission.[36] Before entering a "safari", riders should verify with the driver that they are "dollar ride" and the path. On days when there are many cruise ships in the harbor however, utilizing these fixed path safaris are difficult to catch as most drivers suspend their fixed path service to serve cruise passengers because they make more money doing so. Highways and Major Roads [edit] In the USVI, highways and major routes beginning with 3-4 are located on St. Thomas. Many of these highways and routes pass through or border the town of Charlotte Amalie. Some of the major highways and roads include: Highway 30 (VI 30) passes through Charlotte Amalie as Waterfront Highway/Veteran's Drive. Route 35 (VI 35) enters Charlotte Amalie as Maude Proudfoot Drive (Mafolie Rd.) and ends at Highway 30 as Hospital Gade. Route 38 (VI 38) Alton Adams Sr. Drive and becomes Dronningens Gade East (not connected to Dronningens Gade). Route 40 (VI 40) enters Charlotte Amalie as Theodore Bushelte Dr. and becomes Gamle Nordsidevej in the Charlotte Amalie. Route/Highway 308 (VI 308) start in Charlotte Amalie at Route 314 as Norre Gade and becomes Harwood Highway at the west end of Charlotte Amalie. Route 313 (VI 313) Rumer Drive connecting Highway 30 to Route 38. Route 314 (VI 314) Connects Route 38 on the west side of Bluebeard's Hill to Route 38 on the east side of Bluebeard's Hill. Route 316 (VI 316) First Avenue Step Streets [edit] Steps made from the ballast bricks of the tall ships coming from the Old World Charlotte Amalie is renowned for its numerous historic staircases (or “step streets”), which are a unique feature of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. The 45 step streets,[37] in total, date back to the Danish colonial era and were originally built to help residents and visitors navigate the steep hills of the town. They serve as a network of pedestrian pathways connecting different levels of the hilly terrain of Charlotte Amalie. Many of the staircases remain functional and in use today, offering not only utility but also a glimpse into the town’s history. The steps reflect the ingenuity of Danish urban planning during colonial times, allowing for the development of a town in a challenging, hilly environment.
