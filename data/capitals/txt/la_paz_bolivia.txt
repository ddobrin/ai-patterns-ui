With 755,732 residents as of 2024,[4][5] La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 2.2 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million.[5] It is also the capital of the La Paz Department. The city, in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is in a bowl-like depression, part of the Amazon basin, surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world.[6][7] Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters. La Paz was founded on 20 October 1548, by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza, at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potosí and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Señora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka.[8] La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist Túpac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On 16 July 1809, the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.[9] As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power.[10] The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's gross domestic product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.[11] La Paz is also an important cultural center of South America, as it hosts several landmarks dating from colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Jaén Street. La Paz is also situated at the confluence of archaeological regions of the Tiwanaku and Inca Empire. The city is renowned for its markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its nightlife.[12][13] Its topography offers views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is home to the largest urban cable car network in the world.[14] Name and toponyms [edit] Calle Jaén in the historic center of La Paz, contains well-preserved Spanish Colonial buildings. The Spanish conquistadors founded the city in 1548 with the name Nuestra Señora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco Núñez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru.[15] In 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho). The region in which La Paz is located in was known as Chuquiago Marka (marka means village;[16] Chuqi Yapu means 'gold farm', probably due to the exploitation of gold nuggets in the small rivers of the place;[17] spelling differences due to Aymara writing compared to Spanish transliteration) in the Aymara language, leading former President of Bolivia Evo Morales to suggest renaming the city to "Chuquiago Marka" in a speech in 2017.[18][19] History [edit] Main article: History of La Paz View of La Paz between 1909 and 1920 This area had been the site of an Inca city on a major trading route. Although the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.[15] Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on 20 October 1548, by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.[20] In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society.[citation needed] La Plaza de los Españoles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.[citation needed] Spain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century.[citation needed] In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809, the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces.[citation needed] On 16 July 1809, Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously.[citation needed] This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de América and brought about the Bolivian War of Independence. Plaza Murrillo, the city's main square, seen in 1987. Pedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Españoles several months later, on 29 January 1810.[citation needed] After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America. In 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potosí to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.[21] The segregation of Cholitas (women of Andean indigenous background) continued until the 1980s. They were not allowed to enter certain public places and were banned from cinemas and some restaurants, with more emphasis in Bolivian eastern cities like Santa Cruz De La Sierra.[22] Geography [edit] La Paz is characterized by its mountainous geography, the snow-capped Illimani dominates the city's skyline La Paz is in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. The metropolitan area is near to the Cordillera Real range, which includes such notable mountains as Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Mururata, Huayna Potosi, Chacaltaya, Kunturiri, Llamp'u, Chachakumani, Chearoco, and Ancohuma. La Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado. The geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills. The satellite city of El Alto, where the airport is, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. An earthquake in July 1994 rated at 8.2 struck 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area. In February 2002 the city was subjected to a hail and rainstorm that resulted in flooding causing serious damage and over 50 deaths.[23] Climate [edit] Due to its geographical location and altitude, La Paz has an unusual climate with rainy summers, dry winters and little temperature seasonality La Paz (Laikakota Park) Climate chart (explanation) J F M A M J J A S O N D 126 19 7 81 19 7 68 19 7 27 19 6 8.9 19 5 7.9 18 3 5.3 17 3 12 18 4 25 19 5 38 20 6 44 20 7 82 20 8 █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C █ Precipitation totals in mm Imperial conversion J F M A M J J A S O N D 4.9 65 45 3.2 66 45 2.7 66 45 1.1 67 43 0.4 66 40 0.3 64 38 0.2 63 37 0.5 65 39 1 66 41 1.5 68 43 1.7 69 45 3.2 68 46 █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F █ Precipitation totals in inches At more than 4,000 meters (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have a subalpine subtropical highland climate (Köppen: Cwc), bordering on a tundra climate (Köppen: ET). At this altitude, night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and usually melts before noon. Despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, this part of the city has average temperatures similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or Tórshavn, Faroe Islands. Temperatures in central La Paz, at 3,600 meters (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level are warmer and are classified as subtropical highland climates (Köppen: Cwb).[24] Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 meters, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March. Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. The wettest month is January with a monthly average of 100–140 mm (3.9–5.5 in) of precipitation, and the driest months are June and July with around 5 mm (0.2 in) of precipitation. In the highest part of the city, above 4,000 meters, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.[25] Climate data for El Alto, Bolivia (El Alto International Airport), elevation 4,058 m (13,314 ft), (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1942–present) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 25.4 (77.7) 22.8 (73.0) 25.1 (77.2) 22.9 (73.2) 24.0 (75.2) 20.0 (68.0) 23.0 (73.4) 21.0 (69.8) 23.0 (73.4) 23.0 (73.4) 24.2 (75.6) 22.0 (71.6) 25.4 (77.7) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 14.7 (58.5) 14.7 (58.5) 14.6 (58.3) 15.1 (59.2) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.5 (58.1) 15.3 (59.5) 15.7 (60.3) 16.3 (61.3) 17.3 (63.1) 15.8 (60.4) 15.3 (59.6) Daily mean °C (°F) 9.5 (49.1) 9.5 (49.1) 9.0 (48.2) 8.2 (46.8) 6.5 (43.7) 5.3 (41.5) 5.1 (41.2) 6.0 (42.8) 7.5 (45.5) 8.9 (48.0) 10.0 (50.0) 9.9 (49.8) 8.0 (46.3) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) 4.3 (39.7) 4.3 (39.7) 3.4 (38.1) 1.2 (34.2) −2.1 (28.2) −4 (25) −4.3 (24.3) −3.3 (26.1) −0.8 (30.6) 1.5 (34.7) 2.6 (36.7) 3.9 (39.0) 0.6 (33.0) Record low °C (°F) −3.3 (26.1) −3.3 (26.1) −2.7 (27.1) −4.7 (23.5) −10.3 (13.5) −12.4 (9.7) −11.9 (10.6) −10 (14) −10 (14) −5.4 (22.3) −5 (23) −2.8 (27.0) −12.4 (9.7) Average precipitation mm (inches) 133.7 (5.26) 104.7 (4.12) 71.7 (2.82) 31.7 (1.25) 14.3 (0.56) 5.1 (0.20) 7.1 (0.28) 15.2 (0.60) 35.5 (1.40) 38.1 (1.50) 50.5 (1.99) 94.9 (3.74) 602.5 (23.72) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) 20.7 15.8 14.2 9.8 3.6 2.8 2.8 5.1 8.2 10.4 11.5 15.5 120.3 Average snowy days 0.07 0.0 0.0 0.03 0.0 0.03 0.13 0.67 0.37 0.17 0.17 0.03 1.67 Average relative humidity (%) 66 72 67 59 48 42 43 42 48 49 51 60 54 Mean monthly sunshine hours 179.8 155.4 148.8 165.0 229.4 240.0 235.6 226.3 192.0 179.8 171.0 180.0 2,303.1 Mean daily sunshine hours 5.8 5.5 4.8 5.5 7.4 8.0 7.6 7.3 6.4 5.8 5.7 6.0 6.3 Source 1: Deutscher Wetterdienst (precipitation 1961–1990, humidity 1951–1981),[26] Meteostat[27] Source 2: Meteo Climat (extremes)[28] Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología de Bolivia (snowy days 1981–2010)[29] Climate data for La Paz (Laikakota Park), elevation 3,650 m (11,980 ft), (1981–2010 normals, extremes 1945–present) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 26.5 (79.7) 25.5 (77.9) 26.0 (78.8) 25.0 (77.0) 25.0 (77.0) 23.8 (74.8) 23.1 (73.6) 24.3 (75.7) 26.6 (79.9) 26.5 (79.7) 27.1 (80.8) 27.2 (81.0) 27.2 (81.0) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 18.5 (65.3) 18.7 (65.7) 18.9 (66.0) 19.2 (66.6) 19.1 (66.4) 17.8 (64.0) 17.4 (63.3) 18.4 (65.1) 19.0 (66.2) 19.8 (67.6) 20.4 (68.7) 20.0 (68.0) 18.9 (66.0) Daily mean °C (°F) 12.9 (55.2) 13.0 (55.4) 13.0 (55.4) 12.7 (54.9) 11.8 (53.2) 10.5 (50.9) 10.1 (50.2) 11.0 (51.8) 11.9 (53.4) 13.0 (55.4) 13.7 (56.7) 13.7 (56.7) 12.3 (54.1) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) 7.4 (45.3) 7.3 (45.1) 7.2 (45.0) 6.3 (43.3) 4.6 (40.3) 3.3 (37.9) 2.8 (37.0) 3.7 (38.7) 4.8 (40.6) 6.2 (43.2) 7.0 (44.6) 7.5 (45.5) 5.7 (42.3) Record low °C (°F) 1.5 (34.7) 2.0 (35.6) 1.1 (34.0) 0.6 (33.1) −2.0 (28.4) −6.0 (21.2) −2.8 (27.0) −5.0 (23.0) −0.8 (30.6) 0.0 (32.0) 0.5 (32.9) 1.0 (33.8) −6.0 (21.2) Average precipitation mm (inches) 125.5 (4.94) 81.0 (3.19) 67.5 (2.66) 27.1 (1.07) 8.9 (0.35) 7.9 (0.31) 5.3 (0.21) 12.1 (0.48) 24.5 (0.96) 37.8 (1.49) 43.9 (1.73) 82.3 (3.24) 523.8 (20.62) Average precipitation days 21.3 17.0 15.4 8.6 3.5 2.2 2.1 3.9 6.7 10.7 11.4 16.1 119.0 Average relative humidity (%) 72.0 72.2 70.5 66.2 54.8 48.3 50.4 52.0 58.1 56.5 58.8 64.3 60.0 Mean monthly sunshine hours 145.4 158.4 167.9 187.6 245.7 238.3 240.9 250.1 232.0 215.5 181.5 171.2 2,434.5 Mean daily sunshine hours 5.0 5.9 5.9 6.6 8.2 8.2 8.8 8.5 8.2 7.4 6.8 6.0 7.1 Source: Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología de Bolivia[29] Districts and neighborhoods [edit] La Paz's districts #

San Jorge was one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of some of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, Torres del Poeta, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores.

The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Française and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood. Sopocachi Located in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone. San Pedro Located in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the "Plaza de San Pedro" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's "Rodriguez Market" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here. The Paseo del Prado, one of the main throughfares in the city Centro The city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, 16 July Avenue (also known as "Prado Avenue"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue – the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.

Miraflores In the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, "Central Urban Park") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people). Northern District Located in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway). Southern District Zona Sur, the southern district is largely the most affluent neighborhood in La Paz.

The city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.

(September 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years,[when?] mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. While there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it. La Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. Historically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban center of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. "The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves. The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development."

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered.[35] Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours. Highways [edit] The La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto: The main toll of the La Paz - El Alto highway connects both neighboring cities Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) – Connects La Paz with El Alto. Autovía La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway) – Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potosí, Camargo, Tarija. The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area. Air [edit] El Alto International Airport El Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for Línea Aérea Amaszonas and Transporte Aéreo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviación, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 meters (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world.[36] The runway has a length of 4,000 meters (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport. International carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca and LATAM Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogotá, Lima, and Santiago. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness. Bus [edit] The La Paz Bus Station La Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potosí and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains. Departures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa Fátima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border). Cable car system [edit] Main article: Mi Teleférico The Mi Teleférico transit network is the largest aerial cable car urban transit system in the world. A system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Teleférico ("My Cable Car") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.

There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally. The private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others. Area Code: 2 Country Code: 591 The main daily newspapers in circulation are: Página Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alteño. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines. There are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV. Water supply [edit] La Paz gets its main water supply from nearby lakes fed by the glaciers of the Andes Mountains The water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20–28% of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change, initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto.[37] The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year.[38] The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity.[37][39] New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt. International relations [edit] La Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities[40] from 12 October 1982. La Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur,[41] since 1999.
