As of 2017[update], it had 1,894 inhabitants.[1] History [edit] Philipsburg was founded in 1763 by John Philips, a Scottish captain in the Dutch navy; the settlement soon became a centre of international trade. Two historic forts bear witness to Philipsburg's strategic importance in St. Maarten's history: Fort Amsterdam and Fort Willem.[2] Tourism [edit] Philipsburg Marketplace. The main shopping district, Front Street, is in the heart of the city. The city also has a port that is visited by many cruise liners.

The driest months are from January to July, and the wettest from September to November, when hurricanes are a frequent occurrence in the region. v t e Climate data for Saint Martin (Princess Juliana International Airport) (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1971–2020) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 32.7 (90.9) 31.6 (88.9) 32.6 (90.7) 33.6 (92.5) 34.0 (93.2) 35.2 (95.4) 34.2 (93.6) 35.1 (95.2) 35.0 (95.0) 34.3 (93.7) 33.9 (93.0) 32.1 (89.8) 35.2 (95.4) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 28.6 (83.5) 28.7 (83.7) 29.0 (84.2) 29.6 (85.3) 30.4 (86.7) 31.3 (88.3) 31.5 (88.7) 31.8 (89.2) 31.7 (89.1) 31.2 (88.2) 30.3 (86.5) 29.3 (84.7) 30.3 (86.5) Daily mean °C (°F) 25.7 (78.3) 25.6 (78.1) 25.8 (78.4) 26.6 (79.9) 27.5 (81.5) 28.4 (83.1) 28.6 (83.5) 28.8 (83.8) 28.8 (83.8) 28.3 (82.9) 27.4 (81.3) 26.4 (79.5) 27.3 (81.1) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) 23.3 (73.9) 23.2 (73.8) 23.5 (74.3) 24.2 (75.6) 25.3 (77.5) 26.2 (79.2) 26.3 (79.3) 26.5 (79.7) 26.4 (79.5) 25.9 (78.6) 25.1 (77.2) 24.1 (75.4) 25.0 (77.0) Record low °C (°F) 18.6 (65.5) 18.8 (65.8) 19.1 (66.4) 19.3 (66.7) 20.2 (68.4) 21.8 (71.2) 22.1 (71.8) 21.4 (70.5) 22.0 (71.6) 21.8 (71.2) 20.8 (69.4) 19.9 (67.8) 18.6 (65.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 67.9 (2.67) 49.4 (1.94) 46.9 (1.85) 60.1 (2.37) 98.0 (3.86) 55.0 (2.17) 96.6 (3.80) 106.2 (4.18) 116.1 (4.57) 157.0 (6.18) 162.0 (6.38) 101.0 (3.98) 1,116.2 (43.94) Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) 13 11 8 8 10 9 13 14 13 14 14 14 141 Average relative humidity (%) 74.7 74.1 73.6 75.0 75.9 75.1 74.8 75.4 76.3 76.8 77.4 76.6 75.5 Mean monthly sunshine hours 258.1 245.2 274.8 269.9 253.7 245.8 259.1 267.5 245.1 249.2 238.4 247.1 3,053.9 Source 1: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[6] Source 2: Meteorological Department Curaçao (humidity 1971–2000)[7] See also [edit] List of Designated Monuments in Philipsburg References [edit] ^ "Statistical Yearbook 2017" (PDF).
