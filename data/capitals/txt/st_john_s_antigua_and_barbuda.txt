Bird International Airport Website sjdcanu.com St. John's (Antiguan and Barbudan Creole: Sen Jan)[1] is the largest city of Antigua and Barbuda. It is located in the western part of Antigua, surrounding St. John's Harbour. The city is Antigua and Barbuda's primate city, having a population of 22,219.[2] St. John's also tends to dominate the parish of Saint John, which composes much of the city's metropolitan area. From its establishment after the French invasion in 1666, the city has rapidly grown, eventually replacing Falmouth as the island's dominant city. After its establishment, St. John's became an official trading point in 1675. By 1689, St. John's had overtaken Falmouth in population. St. John's continued to grow throughout the 1700s, occasionally being impacted by a fire or hurricane. St. John's has largely been spared from armed conflict, although a large-scale slave revolt was planned in the city in 1736. St. John's is not necessarily a tourist destination, as it primarily functions as the country's economic centre. St. John's is home to Antigua State College, the country's largest higher education institution, and an open campus of the University of the West Indies. St. John's is attempting to modernise its economy, being home to many convention centres and contemporary office buildings. St. John's is also home to the national library and most government agencies. St. John's is the origin of the All Saints Road corridor, in which most of the country's population lives. While St. John's completely dominates its metropolitan area, the city's economy has stimulated that of surrounding areas like Piggotts and Cedar Valley. History [edit] St. John's was laid out following the French invasion of 1666, due to the site's strategic location on St. John's Harbour.[3] An act was passed to build a town on the harbour in April 1668.[4] On 16 September 1675, a sitting of the island’s legislature in Old Road established six places of trade, one of which being St. John’s. This was a significant increase from the traditional two.[5][6] By 1689, St. John’s was as large as Falmouth.[3] The remainder of the 1600s were largely peaceful, until 7 December 1710. On that date, Daniel Parke was killed after much of his assembly had nearly been expelled from St. John's to Parham.[7] In 1736, a plan by St. John's resident Prince Klaas to turn Antigua into an independent African kingdom was discovered, resulting in him being killed. 132 other co-conspirators were also punished.[8] The plot caused a large scare, and in 1741, barracks were built on Rat Island, and in 1753, in the centre of the town.[9] In 1768, the city was hit by a major fire. By this time, St. John's was also the seat of government of the British Leeward Islands, a title it maintained until the colony's permanent abolishment in 1959. In 1772 the island was hit by a hurricane, resulting in significant damage to the city's shipping industry. In 1782, the city was again damaged by a fire that occurred in one of the most densely populated parts of the city.[10] In 1784, the city's night watch was established, and citizens of the city were subjected to a tax to pay for it. To prevent another fire, building regulations were also improved, with most public buildings being required to have brick walls and tiled or slate roofs. In 1786, another tax was established due to the prevalence of vermin, reptiles, prickly pear bushes lining the streets. The roads were also not paved at the time, nor were they kept clean. Gaming tables were also outlawed.[11] In 1790, the parish vestry was granted the ability to tax traders, which impacted the city due to it being the parish's economic centre.[12] In the early 1800s, the present-day Government House was built.[13] During the late 1800s and early 1900s, St. John's once had an elected city council.[14][15] The council no longer exists, and there is no longer a city-wide local government. In Downtown St. John's, the St. John's Development Corporation continues to handle a degree local government.[16] St. John's is now the country's primate city, being home to around a quarter of its population, and about half of the population of the parish. St. John's was once home to an airstrip in the 1940s at the Old Runway area of Villa, but is now served by V. C. Bird International Airport.[17] While no law explicitly states St. John's is the island's capital,[18] the city is home to the Government Complex in the Botanical Gardens neighbourhood, which is home to the High Court, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Parliament Building. The Parliament building was opened in 2006.[19] The Labour Party largely dominates the city's politics, carrying the city in the 2023 election.[20] Geography and climate [edit] Nearby villages and settlements include St. Johnston. McKinnon's Pond is located just north of St. John's. St. John's has a Tropical savanna climate (Koppen: Aw) with summer-like weather year-round, with hot days and warm nights. Rainfall is at its highest during the months of September to November due to hurricane activity. On 12 August 1995, a temperature of 34.9 °C (94.8 °F) was recorded, which was the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Antigua and Barbuda.[21][22] Climate data for St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda (V.
