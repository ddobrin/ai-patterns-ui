Its official population count was 679,012 inhabitants in 2012; however, over two million people live in the larger urban area.[3] The urban area continues to expand, notably toward the west. The city lies in the southeast of the country, between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Nokoué.[4] Cotonou is the seat of government in Benin, although Porto-Novo is the official capital. History [edit] Fort of Cotonou in 1900 See also: Timeline of Cotonou The name "Cotonou" means "by the river of death" in the Fon language.[5] At the beginning of the 19th century, Cotonou (then spelled "Kutonou") was a small fishing village, and is thought to have been formally founded by King Ghezo of Dahomey in 1830.[5] It grew as a centre for the slave trade, and later palm oil and cotton.[5] In 1851 the French Second Republic made a treaty with King Ghezo that allowed them to establish a trading post at Cotonou.[6] During the reign of King Glele (1858–89), the territory was ceded to the Second French Empire by a treaty signed in 1878.[7] In 1883, the French Navy occupied the city to prevent British conquest of the area. After Glele's death in 1889, King Béhanzin unsuccessfully tried to challenge the treaty. The town grew rapidly following the building of the harbour in 1908.[5] The population in 1960 was only 70,000.[8] Geography [edit] The Ouémé River as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Cotonou Cotonou is on the coastal strip between Lake Nokoué and the Atlantic Ocean. The city is cut in two by a canal, the lagoon of Cotonou, dug by the French in 1855. Three bridges are in this area. The Ouémé River flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Cotonou. Bridge in Cotonou The city has established transportation infrastructure including air, sea, river (to Porto Novo), and land routes that facilitate trade with its neighbors Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso and Togo. Coastal erosion has been noted for several decades. It worsened in 1961 following construction of the Nangbeto Dam and deep-water port of Cotonou. A pilot project funded by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) revealed that in 40 years, the coast to the east of Cotonou had retreated by 400 meters.[9] This erosion has led many people to leave their homes along the coast.[10] Climate [edit] Under Köppen's climate classification, Cotonou features a tropical wet and dry climate, alternating with two rainy seasons (April-July and September–October, totalling 1,000 to 1,300 mm (39 to 51 in) of rain per year) and two dry seasons. In December and January, the city is affected by harmattan winds. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with the average high temperatures hovering around 30 °C (86 °F), and average low temperatures at around 25 °C (77 °F).[11] Climate data for Cotonou (1991–2020, extremes 1910–present) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 36.1 (97.0) 38.6 (101.5) 36.0 (96.8) 35.4 (95.7) 39.0 (102.2) 33.0 (91.4) 33.5 (92.3) 31.8 (89.2) 31.6 (88.9) 33.4 (92.1) 35.4 (95.7) 36.6 (97.9) 39.0 (102.2) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 31.6 (88.9) 32.2 (90.0) 32.3 (90.1) 32.0 (89.6) 31.3 (88.3) 29.6 (85.3) 28.5 (83.3) 28.2 (82.8) 29.0 (84.2) 30.1 (86.2) 31.6 (88.9) 31.9 (89.4) 30.7 (87.3) Daily mean °C (°F) 28.0 (82.4) 29.2 (84.6) 29.6 (85.3) 29.2 (84.6) 28.4 (83.1) 27.1 (80.8) 26.5 (79.7) 26.2 (79.2) 26.7 (80.1) 27.3 (81.1) 28.4 (83.1) 28.4 (83.1) 27.9 (82.2) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) 24.4 (75.9) 26.0 (78.8) 26.8 (80.2) 26.3 (79.3) 25.4 (77.7) 24.5 (76.1) 24.4 (75.9) 24.1 (75.4) 24.3 (75.7) 24.5 (76.1) 25.3 (77.5) 24.9 (76.8) 25.1 (77.2) Record low °C (°F) 17.0 (62.6) 17.9 (64.2) 18.5 (65.3) 20.7 (69.3) 19.6 (67.3) 20.0 (68.0) 18.8 (65.8) 19.8 (67.6) 20.0 (68.0) 19.1 (66.4) 21.0 (69.8) 17.9 (64.2) 17.0 (62.6) Average precipitation mm (inches) 19.4 (0.76) 38.2 (1.50) 80.5 (3.17) 126.1 (4.96) 213.0 (8.39) 333.2 (13.12) 135.2 (5.32) 39.0 (1.54) 134.9 (5.31) 165.1 (6.50) 43.9 (1.73) 12.1 (0.48) 1,340.6 (52.78) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 2 3 6 9 14 18 11 9 14 13 5 1 105 Average relative humidity (%) 75.5 77.3 78.2 79.8 81.3 84.1 84.2 83.7 83.8 83.1 80.6 77.9 80.8 Mean monthly sunshine hours 188.8 188.3 213.5 209.7 196.5 137.7 141.3 150.8 155.1 200.9 233.0 219.1 2,234.7 Source 1: NOAA[12] Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[13] Demographics [edit] Red Star Square 1979: 320,348 (census count) 1992: 536,827 (census count) 2002: 665,100 (census count) 2013: 679,012 (census count) French is the official language of Benin.
