Mariehamn is the seat of the Government and Parliament of Åland, and 40% of the population of Åland live in the city. It is mostly surrounded by Jomala, the second-largest municipality in Åland in terms of population; to the east, it is bordered by Lemland. Like the rest of Åland, Mariehamn is unilingually Swedish-speaking and around 82% of the inhabitants speak it as their native language.[5] The theme of the coat of arms of Mariehamn refers to the city's main livelihood, maritime transport, and the city's parks, which are typically lined with linden trees.[10][11][12][13] The coat of arms was designed by Nils Byman and confirmed in 1951.[14] Due to its central location in the Baltic Sea, Mariehamn has become a major summer resort town for global tourism; as many as 1.5 million tourists visit annually.[15][16][17] History [edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2022) Map of Mariehamn with the pre-1961 territory of the town marked with hatched outline The town was named after the Russian empress Maria Alexandrovna (1824–1880), literally meaning "Marie's Port". Mariehamn was founded on 21 February 1861 around the village of Övernäs,[2][18] in what was at the time part of the municipality of Jomala. The city has since expanded and incorporated more of Jomala territory. Mariehamn was built according to a very regular scheme which is well-preserved. One of the oldest streets is Södragatan where many wooden houses dating from the 19th century can be seen. In the mid 1800's, the business of cargo shipping started to catch on, and many important shipowners and shipyards took their residence in the developing city.[19] Following the First World War, Mariehamn was home to the Mariehamn Grain Fleet.[20] On November 8, 1963, a devastating plane crash occurred in Mariehamn, in which 22 out of 25 people lost their lives, which made it the second-deadliest aviation accident in the history of Finland.[21] Transportation [edit] Harbours [edit] The city is located on a peninsula. It has two important harbours, one located on the western shore and one on the eastern shore, which are ice-free for nearly the whole year, and have no tides.[22] The Western Harbour is an important international harbour with daily traffic to Sweden, Estonia and mainland Finland. A powerful incentive for Baltic ferries to stop at Mariehamn is that, with respect to indirect taxation, Åland is not part of the EU customs zone and so duty-free goods can be sold aboard. Åland and Mariehamn have a reputable heritage in shipping. The Flying P-Liner Pommern museum ship (part of the Åland Maritime Museum) is anchored in the Western Harbour. The Eastern Harbour features one of the largest marinas in Scandinavia. The famous Dutch steamer Jan Nieveen (now called F.P. von Knorring, after Åland teacher and vicar Frans Peter von Knorring) can also be found here. Airport [edit] Mariehamn Airport serves the city; it has scheduled flights on two airlines including Finnair. Roads [edit] At three of Åland's four highways, Mariehamn serves as a starting point for Main Road 1 to Eckerö, Main Road 2 to Sund and Main Road 3 to Lumparland. Culture [edit] The city is an important centre for Åland media; both of the local newspapers (Ålandstidningen and Nya Åland), several radio stations and the local TV channels (TV Åland and Åland24) operate out of the city. The islanders are traditionally fond of reading, and had public libraries before 1920. A printing works was established in the town in 1891.[22] The municipal library, which was built in 1989, is one of the most interesting modern buildings. Museums [edit] Åland Maritime Museum Åland Museum Pommern (ship) Övernässtugan Sjökvarteret Architecture [edit] Architects [edit] Mariehamn features several buildings drawn by Finnish architect Lars Sonck, who moved to Åland as a child. Buildings drawn by him include the church of Mariehamn (1927), the main building of the Åland Maritime College (1927) and the town hall (1939). Hilda Hongell also designed several buildings, although only a few are still standing. The Church of St George [edit] The main parish church of Mariehamn was opened in 1927 and has been expanded in 1959 and renovated in 1972. when the pews were painted blue. The visible decorations include painted wooden ceiling panels, one for each of the followers of Christ. The unnamed panel is that representing Judas Iscariot. The church paintings and decorations are the work of Finnish artist Bruno Tuukkanen. These include the golden mosaics behind the altar which show the life of Christ. Gifts to the church include the font and the ship that hangs from the ceiling. This is the Tjerimaj. The church houses a 37 stop organ built in stages (1969, 1982).[23] Demographics [edit] Historical census populations – Mariehamn Year Pop. ±% 1987 9,966 — 1990 10,263 +3.0% 1997 10,408 +1.4% 2000 10,488 +0.8% 2002 10,632 +1.4% 2004 10,712 +0.8% Year Pop. ±% 2006 10,824 +1.0% 2008 11,005 +1.7% 2009 11,123 +1.1% 2010 11,190 +0.6% 2011 11,262 +0.6% 2012 11,346 +0.7% Year Pop. ±% 2013 11,393 +0.4% 2014 11,480 +0.8% 2015 11,461 −0.2% 2016 11,565 +0.9% 2017 11,677 +1.0% 2018 11,743 +0.6% Source: ÅSUB's statistical databases[24] People with a foreign background[25][26] Country of origin Population (2018) Sweden 1,093 (9.55%) Romania 173 (1.51%) Latvia 163 (1.42%) Iran 101 (0.85%) Estonia 92 (0.80%) Russia 86 (0.75%) Yugoslavia 86 (0.75%) Thailand 73 (0.64%) Philippines 55 (0.48%) United Kingdom 45 (0.39%) Geography [edit] Climate [edit] Mariehamn has a transitional climate between a humid continental climate (Dfb) and an oceanic climate (Cfb) as a result of the strong maritime moderation from being an island in the Baltic Sea. This causes summers to be cooler than both the Swedish and Finnish mainlands, with winters being similar in cold to the adjacent coastal part of Sweden but milder than Finland's mainland. The lowest temperature at Mariehamn airport was −32.9 °C (−27.2 °F) in February 1979, and the highest temperature on record was 31.3 °C (88.3 °F) in July 2022 and July 1941.[27] Climate data for Mariehamn Airport normals 1991-2020, extremes 1914 – present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 10.9 (51.6) 10.5 (50.9) 17.0 (62.6) 21.1 (70.0) 27.1 (80.8) 29.4 (84.9) 31.3 (88.3) 30.7 (87.3) 25.7 (78.3) 19.0 (66.2) 16.6 (61.9) 11.1 (52.0) 31.3 (88.3) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 1.0 (33.8) 0.4 (32.7) 3.1 (37.6) 8.0 (46.4) 13.4 (56.1) 17.5 (63.5) 20.8 (69.4) 20.0 (68.0) 15.5 (59.9) 9.6 (49.3) 5.2 (41.4) 2.5 (36.5) 9.8 (49.6) Daily mean °C (°F) −1.3 (29.7) −2.3 (27.9) −0.2 (31.6) 3.8 (38.8) 8.9 (48.0) 13.3 (55.9) 16.8 (62.2) 16.1 (61.0) 11.8 (53.2) 6.8 (44.2) 3.2 (37.8) 0.4 (32.7) 6.4 (43.5) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) −4.3 (24.3) −5.5 (22.1) −3.7 (25.3) −0.1 (31.8) 4.0 (39.2) 8.6 (47.5) 12.2 (54.0) 11.6 (52.9) 7.8 (46.0) 3.5 (38.3) 0.6 (33.1) −2.5 (27.5) 2.7 (36.9) Record low °C (°F) −32.3 (−26.1) −32.9 (−27.2) −25.0 (−13.0) −18.9 (−2.0) −6.5 (20.3) −3.2 (26.2) 0.1 (32.2) −0.5 (31.1) −6.7 (19.9) −11.8 (10.8) −20.0 (−4.0) −28.9 (−20.0) −32.9 (−27.2) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53 (2.1) 35 (1.4) 38 (1.5) 31 (1.2) 35 (1.4) 53 (2.1) 52 (2.0) 76 (3.0) 61 (2.4) 70 (2.8) 71 (2.8) 59 (2.3) 634 (25) Average precipitation days 17 13 12 9 10 10 9 13 12 16 17 17 155 Mean monthly sunshine hours 39 74 130 207 297 296 312 235 163 91 41 26 1,911 Source 1: FMI climatological normals for Finland 1991–2020[28] Source 2: record highs and lows 1961 – present[29] FMI(record highs and lows 1914-1961)[27] Twin towns and sister cities [edit] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Finland Mariehamn is twinned with:[30] Kópavogur, Iceland Kragerø, Norway Kuressaare, Estonia Lomonosov, Russia (cooperation paused due to Russian invasion of Ukraine)[31] Slagelse, Denmark Tórshavn, Faroe Islands Valkeakoski, Finland Visby, Sweden Notable people [edit] Gustaf Erikson (1872–1947), ship-owner, operated a fleet of windjammers Maggie Gripenberg (1881–1976), dancer and choreographer Georg Kåhre (1899–1969), a teacher and author; he wrote poetry and prose Henrik Klingenberg (born 1978), keyboardist, keytarist and singer of Sonata Arctica Stefan Lindfors (born 1962), an industrial & interior designer, film-maker and sculptor.
