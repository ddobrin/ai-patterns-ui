It is an administrative district in its own right, but is the capital of the surrounding South-East District.[14] Locals often refer to the city as GC or Motse-Mshate.[15] The city of Gaborone is named after Chief Gaborone of the Tlokwa people, who once controlled land nearby.[16] Because it was not affiliated with any specific indigenous group and was close to fresh water, the city was planned to be the capital in the mid-1960s when the Bechuanaland Protectorate became an independent nation.[16] The centre of the city is a long strip of commercial businesses, called "Main Mall" with a semicircle-shaped area of government offices to its east. Gaborone was once one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and this has created problems with housing and illegal settlements. The city has also dealt with conflicts spilling into the country from Zimbabwe and South Africa during the 1980s. Gaborone is the political and economic capital of Botswana, home to its largest companies and the Botswana Stock Exchange. It is also serves as the headquarters of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).[17] The main spoken languages in the city include Setswana (Tswana), English, Kalanga, and Kgalagadi. History [edit] Main articles: History of Gaborone and Timeline of Gaborone A postage stamp circa 1943, the postmark reading "Gaborone's Village" Rev. Derek Jones, the first mayor of Gaborone Evidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the Notwane River for centuries. In more recent history, the Tlokwa left the Magaliesberg ranges to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement Moshaweng. The word "Gaborone" literally means "it does not fit badly" or "it is not unbecoming".[18] The city was then called "Gaberones" by early European colonizers.[19] Gaberones, a shortening of "Gaborone's Village", was named after Chief Gaborone of the Tlokwa,[13] whose home village (now called Tlokweng) was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters. The nickname, "GC", comes from the name "Government Camp".[15] In 1890, Cecil John Rhodes picked Gaberones to house a colonial fort.[20] The fort was where Rhodes planned the Jameson Raid.[19] The city changed its name from Gaberones to Gaborone in 1969.[21][22] The modern town was only founded in 1964, after a decision was taken to establish a capital for Botswana, which became a self governing territory in 1965, before becoming a fully independent republic on 30 September 1966. In 1965, the capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate moved from Mafeking to Gaberones.[23] When Botswana gained its independence, Lobatse was the first choice as the nation's capital.[24] However, Lobatse was deemed too limited, and instead, a new capital city would be created next to Gaberones.[15] The city was chosen because of its proximity to a fresh water source, its proximity to the railway to Pretoria, its central location among the central tribes, and its lack of association with those surrounding tribes.[25] The city was planned under Garden city principles with numerous pedestrian walkways and open spaces.[26] Building of Gaborone started in mid-1964. During the city's construction, the chairman of Gaberones Township Authority, Geoffrey Cornish, likened the layout of the city to a "brandy glass" with the government offices in the base of the glass and businesses in the "mall", a strip of land extending from the base.[27] Most of the early town was built within three years, as a small town designed to accommodate 20,000 people – only to later develop after independence into a modern city. Buildings in early Gaborone include assembly buildings, government offices, a power station, a hospital, schools, a radio station, a telephone exchange, police stations, a post office, and more than 1,000 houses.[28] Because the town was built so quickly, there was a massive influx of labourers who had built illegal settlements on the new city's southern industrial development zone. These settlements were named Naledi. The latter term literally means "the star", but could also mean "under the open sky" or "a community that stands out from all others". In 1971, because of the growth of illegal settlements, the Gaborone Town Council and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands surveyed an area called Bontleng, which would contain low-income housing. However, Naledi still grew, and the demand for housing was greater than ever. In 1973, the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) built a "New Naledi" across the road from the "Old Naledi". Residents from Old Naledi would be moved to New Naledi. However, the demand for housing increased yet again; moreover, the residents who relocated to New Naledi disliked the houses. The problem was solved in 1975 when Sir Seretse Khama, the president of Botswana, rezoned Naledi from an industrial zone to a low-income housing area.[29] On 30 September 1966, Bechuanaland became the eleventh British dependency in Africa to become independent. The first mayor of Gaborone was Reverend Derek Jones.[30] The old Gaberones became a suburb of the new Gaborone, and is now known as "the Village".[15] In the mid-1980s, South Africa attacked Botswana and conducted raids on Gaborone and other border towns. The Raid on Gaborone resulted in twelve deaths. After the 1994 General Elections, riots started in Gaborone because of high unemployment and other issues.[31] Today, Gaborone is growing very rapidly. In 1964, Gaborone only had 3,855 citizens;[32] seven years later, the city had almost 18,000 residents.[33] The city originally planned on 20,000 citizens, but by 1992, the city had 138,000 people. This has led to many squatter settlements on undeveloped land.[34] Former mayor Veronica Lesole has stated that Gaborone's development problems were caused by the original city planners.[35] Geography [edit] See also: Geography of Botswana Satellite View of Gaborone. North is to the left of the image. Gaborone aerial Gaborone is situated at 24°39′29″S 25°54′44″E﻿ / ﻿24.65806°S 25.91222°E﻿ / -24.65806; 25.91222 between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the south-eastern corner of Botswana, and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the South African border.[13] The city lies at an elevation of 1,010 metres (3,310 ft) above sea level. Gaborone is surrounded by the following cities: Ramotswa to the southwest, Mogoditshane to the northwest, and Mochudi to the east, and Tlokweng across the river. Most of them are commuter towns for Gaborone. Suburbs in Gaborone include Broadhurst, Gaborone West, The Village, Naledi.[13] Phakalane, an affluent suburb, lies about 13 km north of the city center.[36] In the centre of the city lies the Main Mall which houses many diplomatic missions. At the eastern end of the Mall, one can find the Civic Centre along with the Pula Arch that commemorates Botswana's independence. The Botswana Stock Exchange, National Museum and Art Gallery, and the main campus of the University of Botswana also lie near the Main Mall. To the west of the Main Mall is the Government Enclave. This area contains the governmental buildings such as the National Assembly of Botswana and Ntlo ya Dikgosi buildings. The National Archives building is also found here. v t e Places adjacent to Gaborone Mogoditshane, Molepolole Dumadumana, Kopong, Lentsweletau Tlokweng, Pilane, Mochudi Gabane, Thamaga Gaborone Modipane, Sikwane Kanye Ramotswa, Otse, Lobatse Climate [edit] Gaborone has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).

Outside the museum, there are various forms of transportation such as wagons, sledges, and bakkies (pickup trucks). There is also an exhibit on the San, the earliest inhabitants of southern Africa.[50] The museum opened a 3.6-hectare (9-acre)[51] botanical garden called the National Botanical Garden on 2 November 2007.[52] The garden was built to protect Botswana's indigenous plant life, and 90% of its total plant species are native plants from Botswana.[51] The Maitisong Festival was started in 1987 and is held every year for seven days on either the last week of March or the first week of April. The festival holds outdoor concerts, plays, and films in various venues around the city.[19] "My African Dream" was a performing-arts competition during the 2000s that was held every year at the Gaborone International Convention Center. The show featured many kwaito dancers and musicians.[31] The book series The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, written by Scottish author Alexander McCall Smith, is set in Gaborone. The books follow Precious Ramotswe, the first female private detective in Botswana, and the mysteries that she solves.

Orapa House is located at the intersection of Khama Crescent and Nelson Mandela Drive.[49] It has a unique style of architecture that allows the optimal amount of indirect sunlight to shine through the windows in order to accurately sort diamonds.[53] A Diamond Technology Park was recently opened[when?], this is as part of Botswana Government's vision for establishment of downstream diamond industry.[citation needed] Companies dealing in diamonds have established their local operations in the park. The Botswana Resource Conference is held annually at the Gaborone International Conference Centre.

Parks and recreation [edit] The Gaborone Dam is located south of Gaborone along the Gaborone-Lobatse road, and provides water for both Gaborone and Lobatse. The dam is the second biggest in Botswana, able to hold 141,400,000 cubic metres (184,900,000 cu yd).[59] It is also starting to be marketed as a recreational area. The northern end of the reservoir is planned to become an entertainment venue called The Waterfront. There is a yacht club, called Gaborone Yacht Club, also on the northern side of the lake. The southern end houses the Kalahari Fishing Club and a new public facility called City Scapes. City Scapes contains parks, playgrounds, and boating facilities.[60] The dam is popular with birdwatchers, windsurfers, and anglers.[19] However, there is no swimming due to the presence of crocodiles and parasitic bilharzias.[53] Wildlife [edit] See also: Wildlife of Botswana Watch house in Gaborone Game Reserve The Gaborone Game Reserve is a 600-hectare (1,500-acre) park east of the city on Limpopo Drive.[49] The reserve was built in 1988 and is now the third-busiest in Botswana. Examples of animals in the park are impala, kudu, ostriches, wildebeest, zebras, gemsbok, bushbuck, springbok, duiker, common eland, and common warthogs.[19] The park is a destination for birdwatching.[50] Birds in the marshy section of the park include snake eagles, boubou, gallinule, kingfishers, and hornbills.[19] Ostriches at Mokolodi Nature Reserve, Botswana Kgale Hill is located a few hundred metres from the city. The hill is nicknamed the Sleeping Giant and is 1,287 metres (4,222 ft). There are three different paths to reach the top, usually taking two hours.[19] The Mokolodi Nature Reserve is a 30-square-kilometre (12 sq mi) reserve that was created in 1994.[61] It is located 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Gaborone.[19] There are many different species of animals found in the park such as common warthogs, steenbok, kudu, zebras, giraffes, common eland, ostriches, hippos and rhinos. The park helps with wildlife projects in Botswana that include: the reintroduction of the white rhino and the relocation of "problem" cheetahs. Mokolodi also holds the Education Centre, which teaches children about the conservation projects.[61] Somarelang Tikologo (Environment Watch Botswana) is a member-based environmental NGO housed inside an ecological park at the heart of Gaborone. The aim of the organization is to promote sustainable environmental protection by educating, demonstrating and encouraging best practices in environmental planning, resource conservation and waste management in Botswana. The park was officially opened by the Botswana Minister of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, Onkokame kitso Mokaila on 27 February 2009. The park contains a playground for children to play on throughout the day, a community organic garden, a recycling drop-off center, and a shop where visitors can purchase products made of recycled material.[62] Government [edit] Main article: Parliament of Botswana The National Assembly of Botswana Local government [edit] Main article: Gaborone City Council Gaborone is controlled by the Gaborone City Council, the wealthiest council in Botswana.[63] It is composed of 35 councillors representing the wards of Gaborone. The Townships Act mandates the structure of local governments in Botswana. Because Botswana is a unitary state, the power of the local councils are delegated from the national level. The Ministry of Local Government, Land and Housing has a major influence in terms of personnel hiring and training, budgeting, and development planning.[64] The city commission-style council is run by the city clerk and the deputy city clerk. The city is governed by the mayor, deputy mayor, and several committees run by councillors: the financial and general purposes committee; the public health, social welfare and housing committee; the Self-Help Housing Agency (SHAA) management committee; the town planning committee; the trade licensing committee; and the education committee.[46] The councillors elect the mayor in a first-past-the-post system and place each other in the committees yearly.[32] The council has 2,515 employees.[46] An income tax called the Local Government Tax used to be the main source of income of the city council, but it was abolished. Today, the city council derives most of its revenue from property rates. City councillors feel that because of recurrent obligations, they have little room to institute new solutions.[64] The city council has been criticised by the Botswana Association of Local Authorities for its closed elections and minimal authority.[32] In 2010, the council had problems with waste management: Frenic, the waste management company hired by the city, sued the Gaborone City Council for unpaid compensation.[65] This has led to a buildup of uncollected garbage.[66] Haskins Nkaigwa, mayor of Gaborone from 2011, has stressed the importance of more local autonomy. He advocates for a stronger city council with the power to determine budgets and hire and fire clerks and officers.[67] National government [edit] Gaborone is the political centre of Botswana. Most government buildings are located west of the Main Mall in an area called the Government Enclave.[49] The National Assembly of Botswana, the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, the National Archives,[26] the Department of Taxes and Attorney General's Chambers Building, and the Ministry of Health. Near the entrance of the parliament building, there is a statue of Sir Seretse Khama, Botswana's first president as well as a memorial dedicated to the three hundred Batswana who were killed from 1939 to 1945.[68] Another monument pays tribute to the Botswana Defence Force soldiers who died in the Rhodesian Bush War.[18] Before 1982, Gaborone held one parliamentary constituency, in the Parliament of Botswana. From 1982 to 1993, Gaborone was divided into two constituencies, Gaborone North and Gaborone South. A third seat in Parliament was given to a member elected for the whole city of Gaborone. In January 1993, two new constituencies were created: Gaborone West and Gaborone Central. For local government elections, the four constituencies were divided into wards. Gaborone North had seven, Gaborone West had seven. Gaborone Central had six, and Gaborone South had five.[46] In 2019, the city had five constituencies: Gaborone North, Gaborone Central, Gaborone South, Gaborone Bonnington North, and Gaborone Bonnington South.[69] An International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) was established on 24 July 2000 in Gaborone. The academy would provide training for middle managers for the countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).[70] There are 21 diplomatic missions in Gaborone.

The growth of Gaborone, especially suburban growth, has caused much of the farmland surrounding the city to be absorbed into the city. Much of the food for Gaborone comes from north of the city with some smaller-scale farms on the southern end.[81] The city centre was planned to be functionalist,[26] with major buildings designed and built in the style of Modern architecture. The city is surrounded by smaller buildings.[82] The city's central business district (CBD) is still under construction so when one says downtown, they actually mean the Main Mall and Government Enclave areas where tall buildings are usually found.[82][83] The Main Mall, a car-free shopping and commercial area, runs in an east–west direction with the Government Enclave and National Assembly on the west end and the Gaborone City Town Council complex on the east.[18] Gaborone's CBD is home to the new Square Mall, The Tower, the new SADC headquarters, the Industrial Court,[84] a court specifically for settling trade disputes,[85] and the Three Dikgosi Monument, a landmark featuring the statues of Khama III, Sebele I, and Bathoen I,[86] three dikgosi, or chiefs, who traveled to Great Britain to establish the Bechuanaland Protectorate separate from Southern Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) or the Cape Colony (present-day South Africa). The monument was inaugurated on 29 September 2005.[87] While the statues represent famous historical figures, there has been some controversy over the cost of the construction, P12,000,000 (approx. US$1.7M, €1.4M, or £1.1M as of June 2010), and over the construction company, North Korean Mansudae Overseas Projects, putting the wrong inscription date.[88] Other buildings under construction in the CBD include the Holiday Inn Gaborone, retail space, and office space.[89] Utilities [edit] The city gets most of its water from the reservoir formed from the Gaborone Dam on the southeast side of the city, which has facilitated growth.[15] The city of Gaborone was originally constructed as a small town, so the Gaborone Dam needed to be built to provide water for all its citizens.[36] From 2007 to 2008, 23,963,000 cubic metres (31,342,000 cu yd) of water was sold in Gaborone. The government sector bought the most water, 11,359,000 cubic metres (14,857,000 cu yd). 8,564,000 cubic metres (11,200,000 cu yd) of water was bought for domestic use, and 4,040,000 cubic metres (5,280,000 cu yd) of water was bought by the commercial and industrial sectors. In 2008, the city of Gaborone consumed 25,657,363 kilolitres (33,558,564 cu yd) of water, and the water consumption per capita was 0.184 cubic metres (0.241 cu yd) per person per year, the lowest rate since 1999.[59] Gaborone has some of the highest water tariffs in the country because of high transportation costs and high water consumption. The high tariffs may also be due to the fact that some of Gaborone's water supply is imported from the Letsibogo Dam.[59] The average pH of the water in the Gaborone Dam is 7.95 as of February 2006. The concentration of calcium in the reservoir was 14.87milligrams per litre from April 2001 to August 2006. During the same period, the concentration of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was 57.73 milligrams per litre, slightly over Botswana's ideal concentration which means the water is hard. Also during the same period, the chloride concentration was 6.44 mg/l, the fluoride concentration was 0.54 mg/l, the potassium concentration was 6.72 mg/l, and the sodium concentration was 10.76 mg/l.[59] Healthcare [edit] Main article: List of hospitals in Botswana Medical rescue team car The Botswana Red Cross Society, established in 1968, is headquartered in Gaborone. The Princess Marina Hospital is the main referral hospital in Gaborone and houses 500 beds.[90] There is also Gaborone Private Hospital and Sidilega Private Hospital all operating in the city of Gaborone. The Cancer Association of Botswana is a voluntary non-governmental organization established as a trust in 1998. HIV/AIDS [edit] See also: HIV/AIDS in Botswana AIDS is a very serious problem in Gaborone. 17,773 Gaborone citizens, 17.1% of the total population of Gaborone, have tested positive for HIV. There is a higher prevalence of HIV among women; 20.5% of women have tested positive compared to 13.6% of men. The population between 45 and 49 years of age are most likely to have AIDS with 35.4% of the residents in that age group testing positive.[54] HIV/AIDS education is extensive in Gaborone. However, a 2008 study shows that 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10 and 64 who have heard of HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can be spread through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV can be spread through mosquito bites.[54] Transportation [edit] Railways [edit] Main article: Rail transport in Botswana The railway that served the founding purpose of the city remains important, bisecting the city in a north–south direction.[13] Botswana Railways runs a line that goes from Cape Town to Harare via Bulawayo. The railway station in Gaborone is located south of the Parliament House in the city's centre.[49] The line stops at the following cities in and near Botswana: Ramatlabama on the South African border, Lobatse, Gaborone, Palapye, Serule, Francistown, Ramokgwebana, and Plumtree, Zimbabwe.[91] The line became a cargo-only line on 1 April 2009[92] but passenger services resumed in early 2016.[93] Airports [edit] Main article: List of airports in Botswana Sir Seretse Khama International Airport (GBE) Sir Seretse Khama International Airport (ICAO code: FBSK[94] IATA code: GBE[94]) lies 25 kilometres (16 mi)[31] north of the city[49] and in 2018 has flights to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Addis Ababa and various domestic destinations.[95] It is the headquarters of Air Botswana, the national airline of Botswana. In 2008, Sir Seretse Khama International Airport handled 15,844 aircraft movements, second only to Maun Airport (ICAO code: FMBN[96] IATA code: MUB[96]) Air traffic in Gaborone has decreased since 2006. However, Gaborone has the most air passenger traffic, accounting for 51.6% of all passenger movement in Botswana. International passengers total 244,073 passengers while domestic air passenger movement comes up to 333,390 passengers.[97] Gaborone International Airport terminal was rebuilt into a modern terminal in 2010. Roads [edit] Road map of Gaborone Highways in and around Gaborone include the Trans-Kalahari Highway, A1 Highway, A10 Highway and the Cairo-Cape Town Highway. There are five major roads in Gaborone that go to Lobatse, Kanye, Molepolole, Francistown via Mochudi, and Tlokweng.[98] Public transport [edit] Kombi Kombi (Minibus taxi) Public transport in the city is generally reliable, when compared with major African cities. Kombis (small vans) and taxis ply the routes within the city, while buses serve surrounding villages and other towns in Botswana.[13] Private traffic [edit] This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (January 2024) Gaborone has several vehicle licensing stations. 15,538 new private motor vehicles, accounting for 46.5% of Botswana's total new vehicle registrations, were registered in Gaborone in 2008, of which 8,440 were passenger cars, 440 were minibuses, 204 were motorcycles, and 181 were tractors. The total has increased from 12,690 new vehicle registrations in 2007. Gaborone also has the highest number of vehicle registration renewals at 73,206 in 2008.[97] Including the district of Gaborone West, Gaborone had 9,415 vehicle accidents with 74 human fatalities in 2008. Most of the traffic collisions in that year, 3,146 collisions, were side collisions. 263 accidents involved animals. The city has also seen 679 pedestrian casualties in 2008; 24 pedestrians were killed. The majority of vehicle accident casualties involved pedestrians, and most traffic accidents occur between 16:00 and 18:00.[97] Notable people [edit] See also: Category:People from Gaborone Letsile Tebogo (b. 2003) Motswana Athlete, Sprinter, won He won the silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in the 100 m Kgosi Gaborone (c. 1825–1931), Motswana chief, after whom the city is named Alec Campbell (1932–2012), archaeologist and museum curator Thamsanga Mnyele (1948–1985), member of the African National Congress and artist Vernon Nkadimeng (1958–1985), member of the African National Congress, killed in Gaborone by the apartheid police Boniface Tshosa Setlalekgosi (b. 1927), Roman Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Gaborone, Botswana from 1981 to 2009 Wally Serote (b. 1944), poet and anti-apartheid activist Dipsy Selolwane (b. 1978), football player Mpule Kwelagobe (b. 1979), Miss World Botswana 1997, Miss Universe Botswana 1999 and Miss Universe 1999 Alister Walker (b. 1982), squash player Abednico Powell (b. 1983), football player Joel Mogorosi (b. 1984), football player Dirang Moloi (b. 1985), member of the Botswana national football team Donald Molosi (b. 1985), actor, writer and playwright attended Maru a Pula School in his teens,[99] and the National Arts Festival in South Africa[100] Sumaiyah Marope (c. 1987), Miss Botswana 2009 Emma Wareus (b. 1990), Miss World Botswana 2010, first runner-up to Miss World 2010 Matsieng, a Setswana traditional music group, formed in Gaborone in 2005 International relations [edit] Gaborone has been twinned with: Burbank, United States[101] Sorong, Indonesia[102] Västerås, Sweden[102] Zhejiang, China[102] Chongqing, China[102] Gallery [edit] Flag map of Gaborone Street scene near the Main Mall Rhodesia Railways car at the national museum View from Kgale Hill (Oodi Hill on horizon) Gaborone Dam Gaborone Dam Botswana Gaborone I Towers Gaborone Hindu Temple Gaborone Mosque CBD CBD Developments New Construction Developments Room 52 Roof Top Restaurant New CBD Christ The King Cathedral CBD Mall SSKI Airport References [edit] ^ Parsons, Neil (19 August 1999).
