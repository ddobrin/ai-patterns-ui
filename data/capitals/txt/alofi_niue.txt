With a population of 610 in 2022,[4] Alofi has the distinction of being the second-smallest capital city of a sovereign state by population (after Ngerulmud, capital of Palau). It consists of two villages: Alofi North and Alofi South. They collectively serve as the capital, but of the two, Alofi South hosts more government buildings, as many were moved to the southern part after Cyclone Heta. History [edit] In 1922 the first hospital in Niue opened in Alofi.[6][7] In January 2004, Niue was hit by the fierce tropical storm Cyclone Heta, which killed two people and did extensive damage to the entire island. Many of Alofi's buildings were destroyed, including the hospital. Government buildings were shifted to a less exposed site 3 km (≈ 2 mi) inland from the west coast,[8] named Fonuakula, after the storm.[9] This site is within the village boundaries of Alofi South. Geography [edit] Overview [edit] It is located at the centre of Alofi Bay on the west coast of the island, close to the only break in the coral reef that surrounds Niue. The bay stretches for 30% of the island's length (about seven kilometres) from Halagigie Point in the south to Makapu Point in the north. The council's territory borders with Avatele, Hakupu, Lakepa, Liku, Makefu, Mutalau, Tamakautoga and Tuapa.[10] Climate [edit] Alofi Climate chart (explanation) J F M A M J J A S O N D 260 28 23 250 29 24 300 28 24 200 27 23 130 26 22 80 26 21 90 25 20 100 25 20 100 26 21 120 26 21 140 27 22 190 28 23 █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C █ Precipitation totals in mm Source: Weatherbase[3] Imperial conversion J F M A M J J A S O N D 10 82 73 9.8 84 75 12 82 75 7.9 81 73 5.1 79 72 3.1 79 70 3.5 77 68 3.9 77 68 3.9 79 70 4.7 79 70 5.5 81 72 7.5 82 73 █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F █ Precipitation totals in inches Alofi features a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification, with no discernible dry season.

It is located at 19°03′10″S 169°55′15″W﻿ / ﻿19.05278°S 169.92083°W﻿ / -19.05278; -169.92083, close to the centre of Alofi, within 200 metres of the capital's post office and just to the north of the Chamber of Commerce building. It is a small wharf, capable—due to the island's topography—of only handling smaller flat-bottomed boats. Larger cargo vessels and fishing boats moor near the reef, and barges are used to offload cargo. Major strengthening, extension work, and renovations to the wharf were commissioned in 2020, after cyclone damage earlier in the year.[13][additional citation(s) needed] Personalities [edit] Dalton Tagelagi (b. 1968), politician Sam Pata Emani Tagelagi (1935–2011), politician See also [edit] Niue High School List of villages in Niue Huanaki Cultural Centre & Museum List of national capitals References [edit] Notes [edit] ^ New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade ^ Government of Niue ^ a b Weatherbase ^ a b "Niue Census of Population and Housing 2022".
