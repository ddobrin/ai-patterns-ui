History and features [edit] Originally a fishing village on a swamp for which it was named, Marigot was made capital during the reign of King Louis XVI of France, who built Fort St. Louis on a hill near Marigot Bay. Today, that building is the most important in Marigot. Marigot is typical of Caribbean towns, with gingerbread houses and sidewalk bistros. Market days are every Wednesday and Saturday morning. The crew of the 1997 motion picture Speed 2 shot the final scene here where the Seabourn Legend hits the island. The St. Martin of Tours' Church on rue du Fort Louis was built in 1941.[1] Geography [edit] Fort St. Louis, 2010 Marigot is located on the west coast of the island of St. Martin. It extends from the coast to the west, along the Bay of Marigot and the hills of the interior of the island to the east. On the south-west it is bounded by the Simpson Bay. Climate [edit] Marigot has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw), with very warm to hot and humid weather throughout the year.[2] Rainfall – which is reduced by the rain shadow of the mountains to the east – is not as extreme as in most climates of this type, with the peak occurring from August to November due to hurricanes. v t e Climate data for Saint Martin (Princess Juliana International Airport) (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1971–2020) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 32.7 (90.9) 31.6 (88.9) 32.6 (90.7) 33.6 (92.5) 34.0 (93.2) 35.2 (95.4) 34.2 (93.6) 35.1 (95.2) 35.0 (95.0) 34.3 (93.7) 33.9 (93.0) 32.1 (89.8) 35.2 (95.4) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 28.6 (83.5) 28.7 (83.7) 29.0 (84.2) 29.6 (85.3) 30.4 (86.7) 31.3 (88.3) 31.5 (88.7) 31.8 (89.2) 31.7 (89.1) 31.2 (88.2) 30.3 (86.5) 29.3 (84.7) 30.3 (86.5) Daily mean °C (°F) 25.7 (78.3) 25.6 (78.1) 25.8 (78.4) 26.6 (79.9) 27.5 (81.5) 28.4 (83.1) 28.6 (83.5) 28.8 (83.8) 28.8 (83.8) 28.3 (82.9) 27.4 (81.3) 26.4 (79.5) 27.3 (81.1) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) 23.3 (73.9) 23.2 (73.8) 23.5 (74.3) 24.2 (75.6) 25.3 (77.5) 26.2 (79.2) 26.3 (79.3) 26.5 (79.7) 26.4 (79.5) 25.9 (78.6) 25.1 (77.2) 24.1 (75.4) 25.0 (77.0) Record low °C (°F) 18.6 (65.5) 18.8 (65.8) 19.1 (66.4) 19.3 (66.7) 20.2 (68.4) 21.8 (71.2) 22.1 (71.8) 21.4 (70.5) 22.0 (71.6) 21.8 (71.2) 20.8 (69.4) 19.9 (67.8) 18.6 (65.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 67.9 (2.67) 49.4 (1.94) 46.9 (1.85) 60.1 (2.37) 98.0 (3.86) 55.0 (2.17) 96.6 (3.80) 106.2 (4.18) 116.1 (4.57) 157.0 (6.18) 162.0 (6.38) 101.0 (3.98) 1,116.2 (43.94) Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) 13 11 8 8 10 9 13 14 13 14 14 14 141 Average relative humidity (%) 74.7 74.1 73.6 75.0 75.9 75.1 74.8 75.4 76.3 76.8 77.4 76.6 75.5 Mean monthly sunshine hours 258.1 245.2 274.8 269.9 253.7 245.8 259.1 267.5 245.1 249.2 238.4 247.1 3,053.9 Source 1: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[3] Source 2: Meteorological Department Curaçao (humidity 1971–2000)[4] Transport [edit] Lighthouse Marigot Lighthouse Location Marigot, Collectivity of Saint Martin, France Coordinates 18°04′16″N 63°05′12″W﻿ / ﻿18.071056°N 63.086528°W﻿ / 18.071056; -63.086528 Tower Constructed est. 1886 Foundation concrete base Construction masonry tower Height 10 m (33 ft) Shape cylindrical frustum tower with light[5][6] Markings white Power source solar power Light Focal height 20 m (66 ft) Range 11 nmi (20 km; 13 mi) (white), 7 nmi (13 km; 8.1 mi) (red), 7 nmi (13 km; 8.1 mi) (green) Characteristic Fl WRG 4s The city is served by Princess Juliana International Airport as well as L'Espérance Airport.
